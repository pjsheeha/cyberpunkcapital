  {text:`<p>London, 18 March 1872<br />To citizen Maurice La Chatre <br />Dear Citizen,<br /><br />I applaud your idea of publishing the translation of Capital as a serial. In this form the book will be more accessible to the working class, a consideration which to me outweighs everything else.<br />That is the good side of your suggestion, but here is the reverse of the medal: the method of analysis which I have employed, and which had not previously been applied to economic subjects, makes the reading of the ﬁrst chapters rather arduous, and it is to be feared that the French public, always impatient to come to a conclusion, eager to know the connection between general principles and the immediate questions that have aroused their passions, may be disheartened because they will be unable to move on at once. That is a disadvantage I am powerless to overcome, unless it be by forewarning and forearming those readers who zealously seek the truth. There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits. Believe me, dear citizen, <br /><br />Your devoted,<br />Karl Marx</p>`,altText: '<p>Alright, so this load of corpo talk from the old Paranoid, Karl Marx, is pretty boilerplate. But &lsquo;member, that long version over on the left, that stuff is legally boring. I&rsquo;m here to make it real easy to understand. He&rsquo;s fixin&rsquo; with his choomba in France and givin&rsquo; him a big thanks for helpin&rsquo; him out with the French Edition of his dirtyscrip, &lsquo;Das Kapital.&rsquo; But Marxy is a bit worried about the French proles not getting it, cuz the first few chapters are so tough to get through.

The sections on the history of the theories of value and of money are now, of course, left out altogether. However, the reader of the earlier work will ﬁnd new sources relating to the history of those theories in the notes to the ﬁrst chapter. Beginnings are always difﬁcult in all sciences.

Why? Because the complete body is easier to study than its cells.</p><p>Moreover, in the analysis of economic forms neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of assistance. The power of abstraction must replace both. But for bourgeois society, the commodity-form of the product of labor, or the value-form of the commodity, is the economic cell-form.

Until now, their locus classicus has been England. This is the reason why England is used as the main illustration of the theoretical developments I make.

This self-opposed movement arises out of the two-edged character of labor. Productiv-ity, of course, is always the productivity of concrete, useful labor; it determines how ef-fective a purposeful productive activity can be in a given period of time. Useful labor becomes, therefore, a more or less abundant source of products in direct proportion as its productivity rises or falls. As against this, however, variations in productivity in them-selves have zero impact on the labor repre-sented in value. As productivity is an at-tribute of labor in its concrete useful form, it naturally ceases to have any bearing on that labor as soon as we abstract from its con-crete useful form. The same labor, therefore, performed for the same length of time, always yields the same amount of value, in-dependently of any variations in its produc-tivity. But it provides different quantities of use-values during equal periods of time; more, if productivity rises; fewer, if it falls.</p>',

By virtue of this, the coat is a &lsquo;carrier of value&rsquo;, although this property does not show through anywhere, even where the coat is at its most threadbare. And in the value relation of the linen, the coat counts only under this aspect, counts therefore as embodied value, as incarnation of value. Despite its buttoned-up appearance, the linen recognizes in the coat a splendid kindred soul, the soul of value. The coat, however, cannot represent value towards the linen unless value, for the latter, at the same time assumes the shape of a coat. An individual, A, for instance, cannot be &lsquo;your majesty&rsquo; to another individual, B, un-less majesty in B&rsquo;s eyes assumes the physi-cal shape of A, and, moreover, changes fa-cial features, hair and many other things, with every new &lsquo;father of his people&rsquo;.</p>',

    {text:'<p>Hence, in the value relation in which the coat is the linen&rsquo;s equivalent, the bodily shape of the coat counts as form of value. The value of the commodity linen is therefore expressed in the physical body of the commodity coat, the value of one in the use-value of the other. As a use-value, the linen is something palpably different from the coat; as value, it is equal to the coat and therefore looks like a coat. Thus the linen acquires a value form different from its bod-ily form. The value-character of linen is manifested in its equality with the coat, just as the sheep-like nature of christians is manifested in their equality with the lamb of god. We see, then, that everything our analysis of the value of commodities previously told us is repeated by the linen itself, as soon as it interacts with another commodity, the coat. Only it reveals its thoughts in the only language it is familiar with, the language of commodities. In order to say that its own value has been created by labor in its abstract quality of be-ing human labor, the linen says that the coat, in so far as it counts as the linen&rsquo;s equal, i.e. in so far as it is value, consists of the same labor as the linen does itself. In order to say that the sublime quasi-material which makes up its value differs from its stiff and starchy existence as a body, it says that value looks like a coat, and there-fore that in so far as the linen itself is a value-thing, it and the coat are as alike as two peas. Let us note, incidentally, that the language of commodities has, in addition to the He-brew, also plenty of other more or less correct dialects. The German word &lsquo;Wertsein&rsquo; (to be worth), for instance, brings out less strikingly than the Romance verb &lsquo;valere&rsquo;, &lsquo;valer&rsquo;, &lsquo;valoir&rsquo; that the equating of com-modity B with commodity A is commodity A&rsquo;s own expression of value.

Whether the coat is expressed as the equivalent and the linen as relative value, or, inversely, the linen is expressed as equivalent and the coat as relative value, the magnitude of the coat&rsquo;s value is determined, as ever, by the labor-time necessary for its production, therefore it is independent of the form of the coat&rsquo;s value.

Two coats can therefore express the magni-tude of value of 40 yards of linen, but they can never express the magnitude of their own value, the magnitude of the value of coats. Because of their superﬁcial reception of this fact—that in the equation of value the equiv-alent always has the form of a simple quan-tity of some article, of a use-value—Bailey and many of his predecessors and followers were misled into considering the expression of value as a merely quantitative relation.</p>',

    {text:'<p>Rather, the equivalent form of a commodity does not contain any quantitative determination of value at all.</p><p>The ﬁrst peculiarity which strikes us when we consider the equivalent form is this, that use-value becomes the form of ap-pearance of its opposite, value. The natural form of the commodity becomes form of value. But, note well, this reversal happens for commodity B (coat, or maize, or iron, etc.) only if some arbitrary other commodity A (linen etc.) enters into a value relation with it, and this reversal holds only within this relation. Since a commodity cannot relate to itself as equivalent, and therefore cannot make its own physical skin into the expression of its own value, it must relate to another com-modity as equivalent, and therefore must make the physical skin of another commodity into its own value form. Let us make this clear with the example of a measure which belongs to commodities as material objects, i.e. as use-values. A sugar-loaf, because it is a body, consists of heavy matter and therefore has a weight, but one can neither see this weight nor touch it. We then take various pieces of iron, whose weight has been determined beforehand. The bodily form of the iron, considered for itself, is no more the form of appearance of heavy matter than is the bodily form of the sugarloaf.</p><p>Nevertheless, in order to express the sugar-loaf as heavy matter, we place it into a weight relation with the iron. In this relation, the iron counts as a body representing nothing but heavy matter.

The bullet loses its ability to be fired&ndash; it&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; a glorified measurin&rsquo; tool. And the body-bag is sittin&rsquo; pretty as the thing we wanted to weigh. When the scale&rsquo;s level, I got the weight of the corpse in the amount of bullets I tossed on. Same with exchanges: the total bullets&rsquo; weight is the relative value, and it&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; represented by the body-bag. So, by usin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; we do know the weight of, we found the weight of somethin&rsquo; we didn&rsquo;t.</p>'},
    {text:'<p>This part is played by the iron only within this relation, i.e. within the relation into which the sugar, or any other body whose weight is to be found, enters with the iron. If both objects lacked heavy matter, they could not enter into this relation, hence the one could not serve to express the heavy matter of the other.If we place both of them on the scales, we see in actuality that as heavy matter they are one and the same, and therefore that, taken in the appropriate proportions, they have the same weight.</p><p>Just as the bodily form of the iron, as a mea-sure of weight, represents nothing but heavy matter towards the sugar-loaf, so, in our ex-pression of value, the bodily form of the coat represents nothing but value towards the linen. Here, however, the analogy ceases. In the weight expression of the sugar-loaf, the iron represents a natural property com-mon to both bodies, their heavy matter; but in the value expression of the linen, the coat represents a supranatural property: their value, which is something purely social. The relative value form of a com-modity, of the linen for example, expresses the value-being of the linen as something quite different from its body and bodily properties, namely, for example, as some-thing which looks like a coat.

He does not suspect that even the sim-plest expression of value, such as 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, already presents us with the riddle of the equivalent form.

The value of the coat is expressed as something which is like linen, that of the tea as something which is like iron. These expressions of the value of coat and tea are therefore as different as linen is from iron. This form, it is plain, appears in practice only in the early stages, when the products of labor are converted into commodities by accidental occasional exchanges.</p><p>The second form, B, distinguishes the value of a commodity more completely from its own use-value, for the value of the coat now contrasts its bodily form by assuming all possible shapes, that of linen, iron, tea, etc., every shape but that of a coat. On the other hand, this immediately excludes any expression of value common to all commodities; for, in the expression of value of each commodity, all other commodities only appear in the form of equivalents. The Expanded form of value comes into actual existence for the ﬁrst time when a particular product of labor, such as cattle, is no longer exceptionally, but habitually, exchanged for various other commodities.</p>',
  altText:'<p>Form we got now&rsquo;s pretty different.   </p><p>All commodities express their values in 2 ways now: simple forms (solo) and unified forms (all commodities can be expressed in the linen). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simple form had us focusin&rsquo; on the difference between use values. Problem was value became a bit too much like comparin&rsquo; use values during exchanges. We were set on sellin&rsquo; our coat to get that sexy, useful linen. Suddenly, the value of a particular commodity became a means to get another use value: value became use-value. This ain&rsquo;t the System as we know it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ok, so we made another form, still separatin&rsquo; use value and value. One thing could represent anything&ndash; except itself. All shit became equivalent, which meant the value within &lsquo;em wasn&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; expressed (only their use-values). All that mattered was everything was equal. The Expanded form arrived when one thing becomes the only thing you usually use to buy everything else. Sort of like money.</p>'},
  {text:'<p>The new form we have just obtained expresses the values of the world of commodities in one single kind of commodity set apart from the rest, in linen for example, and thus represents the values of all commodities through their equality with linen. The equation with linen differentiates the value of every commodity not only from its own use-value, but from all use-values. Hence the value is expressed as that which this commodity has in common with all commodities. Only this form, therefore, has the effect of relating the commodities with each other as values, or enables them to appear to each other as exchange-values. The two earlier forms express the value of a given commodity either in terms of a single commodity of a different kind, or in a series of many commodities which differ from the given commodity. In both cases it is the private task, so to speak, of the individual commodity to give itself a form of value, and it accomplishes this task without the aid of the others, which play towards it the merely passive role of equivalents.</p><p>The general form of value, on the other hand, can only arise as a joint work of the whole world of commodities. A commodity gains a general expression of its value only when, at the same time, all other commodities express their values in the same equivalent; and every newly emergent commodity must follow suit. It thus becomes evident that because the objectivity of commodities as values is the purely &lsquo;social existence&rsquo; of these things, it can only be expressed through an all-sided social relation; consequently the form of their values must be a socially valid form.</p>',

  {text:'<p>In this form, which sets all commodities equal to the linen, the commodities appear not only as qualitatively equal, as values in general, but also as values whose quantities can be compared. Because the magnitudes of their values are expressed in one and the same material, the linen, these magnitudes are now reﬂected in each other. For instance, 10 lbs. of tea = 20 yards of linen, and 40 lbs. of coffee = 20 yards of linen. Therefore 10 lbs. of tea = 40 lbs. of coffee. In other words, 1 lb. of coffee contains only a quarter as much of the substance of value, that is, labor, as 1 lb. of tea.</p><p>The General relative form of value of the world of commodities excludes only one commodity, the linen, on which it imposes the character of General equivalent. The bodily form of the linen is the common form taken by the value of all commodities. Linen is therefore directly exchangeable with all other commodities. The bodily form of the linen counts as the visible incarnation, the general social chrysalis state, of all human labor. Weaving, the private labor which produces linen, is at the same time labor in general social form, the form of equality with all other kinds of labor. The innumerable equations of which the general form of value is composed equate the labor realized in the linen with the labor contained in every other commodity. They thus convert weaving into the general form of appearance of undifferentiated human labor. In this manner the labor objectiﬁed in the values of commodities is not just represented negatively, as labor in which abstraction is made from all the concrete forms and useful properties of actual work.</p>',

  {text:'<p>Rather its own positive nature is explicitly brought out. It is the reduction of all kinds of actual labor to their common character of being human labor in general, of being the expenditure of human labor-power. The General form of value, in which all products of labor are presented as mere congealed quantities of undifferentiated human labor, shows by this general coverage alone that it is the social expression of the world of commodities. Thus it makes it plain that within this world the general human character of labor forms its speciﬁc social character.</p><p>1.3.C.2 <u>Interdependence of the Development of Relative Form of Value and Equivalent Form</u></p><p>The degree of development of the equivalent form corresponds to that of the relative form of value. However it should be noted that the development of the equivalent form is only the expression and result of the development of the relative form. The Simple or Isolated relative form of value of one commodity converts some other commodity into a Simple equivalent. The Expanded form of relative value, that expression of the value of one commodity in terms of all other commodities, imprints on those other commodities the form of various Particular equivalents. Finally, a particular kind of commodity obtains the form of General equivalent, because all other commodities make it the material embodiment of their uniﬁed and gen-eral form of value. Concomitantly with the development of the value form itself, however, develops also the antagonism between the relative form of value and the equivalent form, the two poles of the value form.</p>',

  {text:'<p>The ﬁrst form, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, already contains this antagonism, but does not attach it. According to whether we read the same equation forwards or backwards, each of the two commodity poles (such as linen and coat) is found in the relative form on one occasion, and in the equivalent form on the other. Here it is still difﬁcult to keep hold of the polar antagonism. In form B, only one commodity at a time can expand its relative value into a totality, and it only possesses this Expanded relative form of value because, and in so far as, all other commodities are with respect to it, equivalents. Here we can no longer reverse the equation—such as 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 lb. of tea or = 1 quar-ter of wheat etc.—without altering its whole character, and converting it from the Ex-panded form into the general form of value.</p><p id="c1-24">Finally, the last form, C, gives to the world of commodities a general social relative form of value, because, and in so far as, all commodities except one are thereby excluded from the equivalent form.

That control shows that the longer it takes to make something useful, the higher in value it must be to society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) If a solo can&rsquo;t make something themselves, they join up with other producers.

Commodities get weird *because* they get exchanged: and that&rsquo;s what makes &lsquo;em commodities in the first place. In the System, these 3 obvious things go under something else&rsquo;s control. Products gotta enter the System to be commodities, and they start gettin&rsquo; exchanged. That&rsquo;s when the weird shit starts. Since all human labor is just humans doin&rsquo; labor, all human labor is equal to each other as a solo unit. The System allows human labor to take a form with unlimited power: here, human labor can make anything. Human labor, somethin&rsquo; totally abstract, actually takes on a form that can make anything.

I, ch. 5, pp. 104&ndash;5].</p><p>On the one hand, Adam Smith here (but not everywhere) confuses the determination of the values of commodities by the quantity of la-bor expended in their production with the determination of the values of commodities by the value of labor. This is why he ﬁnds it necessary to prove that equal quantities of labor always have the same value. On the other hand, he has the hunch that, in so far as labor manifests itself in the value of commodities, it only counts as an expenditure of labor-power.</p><p>But then he views this expenditure merely as the sacriﬁce of ease, liberty, and hap-piness, not also as man&rsquo;s normal life activity.</p><p>He is guided here by the evidence of the modern wage laborer.</p><p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s anonymous predecessor, cited in note 9, is much nearer the mark when he says: &lsquo;One man has employed himself a week in providing this necessary of life . . . and he that gives him some other in exchange, cannot make a better estimate of what is a proper equivalent, than by computing what cost him just as much labor and time: which in effect is no more than exchanging one man&rsquo;s labor in one thing for a time certain, for another man&rsquo;s labor in another thing for the same time&rsquo; [Ano39, p. 39].</p><p>Note by Engels to the fourth German edition:] The English language has the advan-tage of possessing two separate words for these two different aspects of labor.

And cuz of that I&rsquo;ll give you what you can&rsquo;t do, that I made usin&rsquo; the same amount of effort. But Marx ain&rsquo;t playin&rsquo; with stupid units like effort. Our verbage on how hard one thing is to make over another comes from our experiences, but we can&rsquo;t *actually* know the experiences of the runner we&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; a deal with. How can we say how much harder somethin&rsquo; was to make for you than it was for me while we&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; a deal?

  {text:'<p><a href="#c1-31" class="black"><b>31.</b></a> The insufﬁciency of Ricardo&rsquo;s analysis of the magnitude of value—and his analysis is by far the best—will become apparent from the third and fourth books of this work.</p><p>As regards value itself, classical political economy nowhere distinguishes explicitly and with full awareness between the labor rep-resented in the value of a product and the same labor manifest in its use-value. Of course the classical economists do, in actual fact, make this distinction, for they treat labor sometimes from its quantitative aspect, and at other times qualitatively. It does not occur to them that a purely quantitative difference be-tween different kinds of labor presupposes their qualitative unity or equality, and therefore their reduction to abstract human labor. For instance, Ricardo declares himself in agreement with Destutt de Tracy when the latter says: &lsquo;As it is certain that our physical and moral faculties are alone our original riches, the em-ployment of those faculties, labor of some kind, is our original treasure, and it is always from this employment that all those things are created which we call riches . . . It is certain, too, that all those things only represent the labor which has created them, and if they have a value, or even two distinct values, they can only derive them from that&rsquo; (the value) &lsquo;of the labor from which they emanate&rsquo; (Ricardo, The Principles of Politi-cal Economy, 3rd Edn, London, 1821, p. 334).</p><p>I shall content myself here with point-ing out that Ricardo puts his own more profound interpretation upon the words of Destutt. The Frenchman does, in fact, say on the one hand that all things which constitute wealth &lsquo;represent the labor which has created them,&rsquo; but he also says, on the other hand, that they acquire their &lsquo;two different values&rsquo; (use-value and exchange-value) from &lsquo;the value of labor.&rsquo; He thus lapses into the shallowness of the vulgar economist, who pre-supposes the value of one commodity (labor, in this case) so that he can then determine the val-ues of the other commodities. But Ricardo reads him as if he had said that labor (not the value of labor) is represented both in use-value and in exchange-value. Nevertheless, Ricardo himself pays so little attention to the twofold character of labor behind its twofold expression, that his whole chapter &lsquo;Value and Riches, their Distinctive Properties&rsquo; is largely devoted to laborious refutation of the trivialities of a J. B.

  {text:'<p><a href="#c1-32" class="black"><b>32.</b></a> It is one of the chief failings of classical political economy that it has never pursued the analysis of commodities and more speciﬁcally of commodity value to the point where it yields the form of value, i.e., that what turns value into exchange-value. Even its best representatives, Adam Smith and Ricardo, treat the form of value as something quite indifferent or extraneous to the nature of the commodity itself.</p><p>The reason for this is not solely that their attention is entirely absorbed by the analysis of the magnitude of value. It lies deeper. The value form of the product of labor is the most abstract, but also the most general form of the bourgeois mode of production. It characterizes this mode of production as a particular species of social production, and therewith as one of a historical and transitory character. If one considers it to be the eternal natural form of social production, one necessarily overlooks the speciﬁcity of the value form as well—and consequently that of the com-modity form, together with its further develop-ments, the money form, the capital form, etc.</p><p>That is why certain economists who are entirely agreed that labor-time is the measure of the magnitude of value, have the strangest and most contradictory notions concerning money, the universal equivalent in its ﬁnished form. This emerges sharply when they deal with banking, where the commonplace deﬁnitions of money will no longer do. Hence there has arisen in opposition to the classical economists a restored Mercantilist System (Ganilh etc.), which sees in value only the social form, or rather the insub-stantial ghost of that form.—</p><p>Let me point out once and for all that by classical political economy I mean all the econo-mists who, since the time of W. Petty, have in-vestigated the real inner structure of bourgeois relations of production, as opposed to the vul-gar economists who only ﬂounder around within the apparent structure of those relations, cease-lessly ruminate on the materials long since pro-vided by scientiﬁc political economy, in order to lend plausibility to the crudest phenomena for bourgeois daily food. Apart from this, the vulgar economists conﬁne themselves to systematizing in a pedantic way, and proclaiming for everlast-ing truths, the banal and complacent notions held by the bourgeois agents of production about their own world, which is to them the best possible one.</p>',altText:'<p id="f1-32">What&rsquo;s leashin&rsquo; these infobros to not analyze what turns value into exchange value?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even the Ferrymen of the System, Adam Smith and Ricardo, treat value like its got nothin&rsquo; to do with how commodities act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This ain&rsquo;t just cuz they&rsquo;re obsessed with figurin&rsquo; out how we measure value. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See, it&rsquo;s a deeper problem.

  {text:'<p><a href="#c1-33" class="black"><b>33.</b></a> &ldquo;The economists have a singular way of proceeding. For them, there are only two kinds of institutions, artiﬁcial and natural. The in-stitutions of feudalism are artiﬁcial institutions, those of the bourgeoisie are natural institutions. In this they resemble the theologians, who like-wise establish two kinds of religion. Every reli-gion which is not theirs in an invention of men, while their own is an emanation of God . . .

Proudhon, 1847, p. 113).</p><p>Truly comical is M. Bastiat, who imagines that the ancient Greeks and Romans lived by plunder alone. For if people live by plunder for centuries there must, after all, always be something there to plunder; in other words, the ob-jects of plunder must be continually reproduced. It seems, therefore, that even the Greeks and the Romans had a process of production, hence an economy, which constituted the material basis of their world as much as the bourgeois economy constitutes that of the present-day world. Or per-haps Bastiat means that a mode of production based on the labor of slaves is based on a sys-tem of plunder? In that case he is on dangerous ground. If a giant thinker like Aristotle could err in his assessment of slave labor, why should a dwarf economist like Bastiat be right in his as-sessment of wage labor?</p><p>I seize this opportunity of brieﬂy refut-ing an objection made by a German-American publication to my work A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, 1859.</p><p>My view is that each particular mode of production, and the relations of production corresponding to it at every given moment, in short &lsquo;the economic structure of society&rsquo;, is &lsquo;the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond deﬁnite forms of social consciousness&rsquo;, and that &lsquo;the mode in which material life is produced conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life&rsquo;. In the opinion of the German-American publication this is all very true for our own times, in which material interests are preponderant, but not for the Middle Ages, dominated by Catholicism, nor for Athens and Rome, dominated by politics.</p><p>In the ﬁrst place, it strikes us as odd that anyone should suppose that these well-worn phrases about the Middle Ages and the ancient world were unknown to anyone else. One thing is clear: the Middle Ages could not live on Catholicism, nor could the an-cient world on politics. On the contrary, it is the manner in which they gained their livelihood which explains why in one case politics, in the other case Catholicism, played the main role. Re-garding the Roman Republic, for instance, one needs no more than a slight acquaintance with its history to be aware that its secret history is the history of landed property. On the other hand, already Don Quixote had to pay for the mistake of believing that knight erranty was equally com-patible with all economic forms of society.</p>',altText:'<p id="f1-33">Econo-posers make the System into their own private cult cube.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Feudalism was a false idol&ndash; the System is the true religion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Corpo-priests gotta convert the world to the bourgys&rsquo; electronic god.

Long before the economists, it was the lawyers who made fashionable the idea that money is a mere symbol, and that the value of the precious metals is purely imaginary. This they did in the sycophantic service of the royal power, supporting the right of the latter to de-base the coinage, during the whole of the Middle Ages, by the traditions of the Roman Empire and the conceptions of money to be found in the Digest. &lsquo;Let no one call into question,&rsquo; says their apt pupil, Philip of Valois, in a decree of 1346, &lsquo;that the trade, the composition, the supply, and the power of issuing ordinances on the currency . . . belongs exclusively to us and to our royal majesty, to ﬁx such a rate and at such a price as it shall please us and seem good to us.&rsquo; It was a maxim of Roman Law that the value of money was ﬁxed by Imperial decree. It was expressly forbidden to treat money as a commodity. &lsquo;How-ever, it shall not be lawful for anyone to buy money, for, as it was created for public use, it is not permissible for it to be a commodity&rsquo;.

{text:'<p>Throughout this work I assume, for the sake of simplicity, that gold is the money-commodity. The ﬁrst function of gold is: to pro-vide the world of commodities with the ma-terial in which they can express their values, or: to represent the values of the commodi-ties as magnitudes of the same denomina-tion, qualitatively equal and quantitatively comparable.</p><p id="c3-50">It thus functions as a general measure of value, and it is at ﬁrst only by this function that gold, the speciﬁc equivalent commod-ity, becomes money. The commodities do not become commensurable through money. Quite the contrary. Only because all commodities, as values, are objectiﬁed human labor, and are therefore in and for themselves commensu-rable, can they jointly measure their values in one and the same speciﬁc commodity, and thus turn this commodity into the common measure of their values, i.e. into money. Money as a measure of value is the nec-essary form of appearance of the imma-nent measure of value of the commodities, namely labor-time.<sub><a href="#f3-50" class="black inline"><b>50</b></a></sub></p><p>The expression of the value of a commodity in gold—x commodity A = y money commodity—is the commodity&rsquo;s money form or its price. A single equation, such as 1 ton of iron = 2 ounces of gold, now sufﬁces to express the value of iron in a socially valid manner. There is no longer any need for this equation to line up together with all other equations that express the val-ues of the other commodities, because the equivalent commodity, gold, already pos-sesses the character of money. The com-modities&rsquo; general relative value form has thus the same shape as their original relative value form, the Simple or Individual form of value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
altText:'<p>Gold&rsquo;s got a lot of responsibility for its job. It got carried thru a lot of Econ-Warfare, but now, it&rsquo;s got the promotion of top-dog in the System. Don&rsquo;t forget this shit! There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; built-in to gold to make it valuable. But because of the way history worked out, it was the value rep back in Marxy&rsquo;s day&ndash; not just the object of desire, but also every commodity&rsquo;s new pimp. Hands back a price with a number on it to any interested buyers. Gold claims it learned a lot on its trip to the top, and wants to give back&ndash; wants to be a whistleblower to the secrets of the System. The cards it gives out have got a concrete, human readable units on &lsquo;em&ndash; how many pounds of Gold-flesh the commodity bein&rsquo; sold is worth. All DealMakers can see this Global variable&ndash; meanin&rsquo; all commodities got a public, opensource unit of value now, certed by gold. That should make ya suspicious&ndash; one source for a leak? I don&rsquo;t trust like that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So Money&rsquo;s the Middleman&ndash; but what&rsquo;s with all the distance? Why can&rsquo;t we just get the value, instead of havin&rsquo; to go thru some sweet-talking, fused together Metalhead? Let&rsquo;s think. From Chapter 1, we know commodities have value, cuz they&rsquo;re products of abstract human labor. Exchange only works if both commodities got the same amount of value on opposin&rsquo; sides of the equation. Value&rsquo;s the only unit we can use&ndash; its measurement is labor-time. Problem is, Labortime&rsquo;s built-in, but not public, not human readable, but super pervasive, since anybody can do it. Yet somehow, King Gold&rsquo;s got the perfect access route to it, and is givin&rsquo; it away, for free. No huge security Big Bro type State needed to track all Labor Time: just some shit from the dirt. Why mistrust it then? Seems like Gold just saved the System. It earned the job: it only came out as the System *upgraded*, not devolved. Evolved out of that weaknesses of the Expanded Form, the General Form&ndash; this time, *society* promoted it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gold gives out its price and asks nothin&rsquo;. Well, not exactly nothin&rsquo;: Gold&rsquo;s got the Net on its knees, the only thing that makes sense to be in a deal&ndash; because while the other side can be anythin&rsquo;, one side&rsquo;s *always* gotta be some amount of Gold. This form of value LOOKS the same as the Simple form of Value back in Chapter 1. THING IS… GOLD DON&rsquo;T PLAY by the rules. It&rsquo;s almost the same: gold is still reppin&rsquo; the value of the relative value form. The value of the thing gettin&rsquo; sold got repped by the use-value of the thing gettin&rsquo; bought.  But with price, the use-value made by concrete labor ain&rsquo;t important anymore. All that matters is the *social* use-value, which the System made: that Money can get anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'},
{text:'<p>On the other hand, the Expanded relative ex-pression of value, the endless series of equa-tions, has now become the speciﬁc relative form of value of the money commodity.</p><p>The endless series, however, is already so-cially given in the prices of the commodi-ties. We only need to read the quotations of a price list backwards, to ﬁnd the magnitude of the value of money expressed in all pos-sible commodities.</p><p>A price, however, money does not have. This uniform relative form of value of the other commodities is not open to money, be-cause money cannot be brought into relation with itself as its own equivalent. The price or money form of commodities, like their form of value gener-ally, is a form different from their palpable and real bodily forms, i.e., it is a merely no-tional or imagined form.</p><p id="c3-51">Although invisible, the value of iron, linen and corn exists in these very articles: it is made accessible through their equality with gold, a relation with gold which exists, so to speak, only in their heads.

It also does not require the tiniest particle of real gold to give a valua-tion in gold of millions of pounds&rsquo; worth of commodities.

{text:'<p>But, although the money that performs the function of a measure of value is only imag-ined, the price depends entirely on the actual substance that is money. The value, i.e. the quantity of human labor contained in a ton of iron, is expressed by an imagined quan-tity of the money commodity containing the same amount of labor as the iron. There-fore according to whether it is gold, silver or copper which is serving as the measure of value, the value of the ton of iron obtains very different price expressions, or will be represented by very different quantities of those metals.</p><p id="c3-53">If therefore two different com-modities, such as gold and silver, serve simultaneously as measures of value, all commodities will have two separate price-expressions, the price in gold and the price in silver, which will quietly co-exist as long as the ratio of the value of silver to that of gold remains unchanged, say at 1:15. How-ever, every alteration in this ratio disturbs the ratio between the gold prices and the sil-ver prices of commodities, and thus proves in fact that a duplication of the measure of value contradicts the function of that mea-sure.<sub><a href="#f3-53" class="black inline"><b>53</b></a></sub></p><p>After they are given their prices, all commodities present themselves in the form: a commodity A = x gold; b commod-ity B = y gold; c commodity C = z gold, etc., where a, b, c represent deﬁnite quan-tities of the commodities A, B, C, and x, y, z deﬁnite quantities of gold.

If the conditions of production, or the produc-tivity of labor, remain constant, the same amount of social labor-time must be ex-pended on the reproduction of a quarter of wheat, both before and after the change in price. This situation is not dependent on the will of the wheat producer or that of the owners of the other commodities.

Things which in and for themselves are not commodities, things such as conscience, honor, etc., can be of-fered for sale by their holders, and thus ac-quire the form of commodities through their price. Hence a thing can, formally speak-ing, have a price without having a value. The expression of price is in this case imaginary, like certain quantities in mathemat-ics. On the other hand, the imaginary price-form may also conceal a real value-relation or one derived from it, as for instance the price of uncultivated land, which is without value because no human labor is objectiﬁed in it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

The ellipse is one of the forms of motion in which this contradiction both as-serts itself and resolves itself.</p><p>In so far as the process of ex-change transfers commodities from hands in which they are non-use-values to hands in which they are use-values, it is a process of social metabolism. The product of one kind of useful labor replaces that of another. Once a commodity has arrived at a place where it can serve as use-value, it falls out of the sphere of exchange into that of con-sumption. Only the exchange is of inter-est to us here. Therefore we must look at the whole process from the form side. We must investigate the form change—or the metamorphosis—of commodities, which mediates the social metabolism. This change of form has been very imperfectly grasped as yet, owing to the cir-cumstance that, quite apart from the lack of clarity in the concept of value itself, every change of form in a commodity results from the exchange of two commodities, namely an ordinary commodity and the money com-modity. If we keep in mind only this material aspect, that is, the exchange of the com-modity for gold, we overlook the very thing we ought to observe, namely what has hap-pened to the form of the commodity. We do not see that gold, as a mere commodity, is not money, and that the other commodi-ties, through their prices, relate themselves to gold as the their own monetary shape. Commodities ﬁrst enter into ex-change ungilded, without a sugar coating, in their original home-grown shapes. The pro-cess of exchange, however, produces a du-plication of the commodity into commodity and money, an external opposition in which the commodities represent their internal op-position between use-value and value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

For the weaver, the whole process accomplishes nothing more than the exchange of the product of her labor for the product of some-one else&rsquo;s, nothing more than an exchange of products.</p><p>The process of exchange is there-fore accomplished through the following changes of form:</p><p>Commodity—Money—Commodity</p><p>C −M −C.</p><p>As far as its material content is concerned, the movement is C −C, the ex-change of one commodity for another, the metabolic interaction of social labor, . . .</p><p>. . . in whose result the process itself be-comes extinguished.</p><p>C − M.

If the leap falls short, it is not the commod-ity which is bruised but rather its owner. The social division of labor makes the na-ture of her labor as one-sided as her needs are many-sided. The product of her labor serves her therefore merely as exchange-value. It cannot acquire a General socially valid equivalent form except by being converted into money—however that money is in someone else&rsquo;s pocket.</p><p>In order to extract this money, the com-modity produced by its owner&rsquo;s labor must above all be a use-value for the owner of the money.

{text:'<p>Moreover, although our weaver&rsquo;s labor may be a recognized branch of the social divi-sion of labor, yet that fact is by no means sufﬁcient to guarantee the utility of her 20 yards of linen. If the society&rsquo;s need for linen—and such a need has a limit like every other need—has already been satisﬁed by the products of rival weavers, our friend&rsquo;s product is in excess, superﬂuous, and conse-quently useless.</p><p>Although people do not look a gift-horse in the mouth, our friend does not frequent the market to make presents of his products.</p><p>Let us assume, however, that the use-value of her product proves itself, and that the commodity therefore attracts money.

No doubt the answer is already anticipated in the price of the commodity, which is the ex-ponent of the magnitude of its value.</p><p>We leave out of consideration here any pos-sible subjective errors in calculation by the owner of the commodity, which will imme-diately be corrected objectively in the mar-ket.</p><p>We suppose him to have spent on his prod-uct only the average socially necessary quantity of labor-time.</p><p>The price of the commodity is therefore just the money-name of the quantity of social la-bor objectiﬁed in it.</p><p>But now the old-established conditions of production in weaving are thrown into the melting-pot, without the permission of, and behind the back of, our weaver. What was yesterday undoubtedly labor-time socially necessary for the production of a yard of linen ceases to be so today, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend&rsquo;s competitors. Unluckily for the weaver, peo-ple of her kind are in plentiful supply.</p><p>Let us suppose, ﬁnally, that every piece of linen on the market contains nothing but so-cially necessary labor-time. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole may con-tain superﬂuously expended labor-time. If the market cannot stomach the whole quan-tity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total social labor-time has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had ex-pended more labor-time on his or her particular product than was socially necessary. As the German proverb has it: caught to-gether, hung together. All the linen on the market counts as one single article of com-merce, and each piece of linen is only a pro-portional part of it. And in fact the value of each single yard is also nothing but the ma-terialization of the same socially determined quantity of homogeneous human labor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
altText:'<p>To pile onto this, a job can get the all clear of bein&rsquo; socially needed: weavers make their linen, but that ain&rsquo;t a guarantee that society actually needs that linen.

By the time the linen makes it to market, there may be new tech to cut the social labor time down to the min: and now, buyers are gonna bring price tags from other Big Block stores to show that the LinenWeaver&rsquo;s sellin&rsquo; overpriced draga. Unfortunate for the LinenWeaver: robots make linen so fast and so cheap, for her to compete she&rsquo;s gotta sell it for pennies on the dollar. </p><p>But let&rsquo;s say the LinenWeaver&rsquo;s actually owns these robots: now everyone on the Market&rsquo;s got linen with the same amount of socially necessary labor-time. Thing is, now we got another Linenpocalypse situation. Now: there&rsquo;s definitely gonna be too much linen than society needs. If customers already got enough linen, they ain&rsquo;t gonna want to pay the same for extra: they&rsquo;re gonna want it cheap. It&rsquo;s like when a LinenWeaver takes too long to make their shit: they&rsquo;re gonna get outcompeted by the people who did it fastest.

But where are you gonna cut it from&ndash; nobody&rsquo;s got edge, nobody&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; anything different from eachother.

{text:'<p>We see then that commodities are in love with money, but &lsquo;the course of true love never does run smooth&rsquo;. The quantita-tive articulation of society&rsquo;s productive or-ganism, by which its scattered elements are integrated into the system of the division of labor, is as haphazard and spontaneous as its qualitative articulation. The owners of commodities therefore ﬁnd out that the same division of labor which turns them into independent private producers also makes the social process of production and the re-lations of the individual producers to each other within that process independent of the producers themselves; they also ﬁnd out that the independence of the individuals from each other is supplemented by a system of all-round material dependence.</p><p>The division of labor converts the product of labor into a commodity, and thereby makes necessary its conversion into money. At the same time, it makes it a mat-ter of chance whether this transubstantiation succeeds or not. Here, however, we have to look at the phenomenon in its pure shape, and must therefore assume it has proceeded normally. In any case, if the process is to take place at all, i.e. if the commodity is not impossible to sell, a change of form must always occur, although there may be an ab-normal loss or accretion of substance—that is, of the magnitude of value.</p><p>The seller has her commodity re-placed by gold, the buyer has his gold re-placed by a commodity. The palpable phe-nomenon here is that a commodity and gold, 20 yards of linen and £2, have changed hands and places, in other words that they have been exchanged. But what is the com-modity exchanged for? For the general shape assumed by its own value. And what is the gold exchanged for? For a particular form of its own use-value.</p><p>Why does gold confront the linen as money?Because the linen&rsquo;s price of £2, its money-name, already brings it into relation with the gold as money.</p><p id="c3-66">The disembodiment of the original com-modity form is effected by the externaliza-tion, the sale, of the commodity, i.e., in the moment when its use-value actually attracts the gold to which it previously had a merely imagined relation in its price. The actualiza-tion of a commodity&rsquo;s price, or of its merely notional value form, is therefore at the same time, and inversely, the actualization of the merely notional use-value of money; the conversion of a commodity into money is the conversion of money into a commodity. This single process is two-sided: from one pole, that of the commodity owner, it is a sale, from the other pole, that of the money owner, it is a purchase. In other words, a sale is a purchase, C −M is also M −C.<sub><a href="#f3-66" class="black inline"><b>66</b></a></sub></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

Owners figure out pretty speedy that the fact they&rsquo;re solo, indie producers means they&rsquo;re on their own together: while they&rsquo;re all individuals, the commodities ain&rsquo;t in love with us: they want our money. And since what we need to survive is all commodified: all Owners are addicted to buyin&rsquo; and sellin&rsquo; to get enough money to get whatever the fuck it is we need to continue to live&ndash; while tryin&rsquo; to stay as far away from eachother as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cuz we&rsquo;re solos, none of us is gonna do work unless we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; our money&rsquo;s worth.

Only the shit that can actually get a sale: not garbage collection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then the commodity gets its magnitude of value beamed back to it in gold. The gold replaces the commodity: it dopelgangs that shit, pulls a switcheroo. An exchange happens: commodity gets switched for a standardized SysUnit of value juice.

The commodity became money. It doin&rsquo; that allowed gold to &ldquo;get&rdquo; a use-value, it bought somethin, fulfilled what it&rsquo;s advertised as: money gets you anythin&rsquo;. So now, money, havin&rsquo; a use-value and a value, is a commodity. This makes two crazy things happen: on one side, the Seller made a sale, on the other, the Buyer bought.

{text:'<p>Up to this point we have con-sidered only one economic relation between people, namely, that between commodity owners. They can own the product of alien labor only by alienating the product of their own labor. For a commodity owner to con-front another as a money owner it is there-fore necessary either that the product of the latter should possess by its nature the form of money, i.e. it should be gold, the material of which money consists, or that his product should already have changed its skin and stripped off its original form of a useful ob-ject.</p><p id="c3-67">In order to function as money, gold must of course enter the market at some point or other. This point is to be found at its source of production, where the gold is exchanged, as the immediate product of labor, for some other product of equal value. But from that moment onwards, it always represents the actualized price of some commodity.<sub><a href="#f3-67" class="black inline"><b>67</b></a></sub></p><p id="c3-68">Leaving aside the exchange of gold for other commodities at its source of production, gold is, in the hands of every commodity-owner, the disembodied shape of the sold commodity, it is the product of the ﬁrst me-tamorphosis C −M.<sub><a href="#f3-68" class="black inline"><b>68</b></a></sub> Gold, as we saw, became notional money, or measure of value, because all commodities measured their val-ues in it and thus made it the imagined op-posite of their natural shape as objects of utility, i.e., made it the shape of their value. It became actual money because the com-modities, through their all-sided external-ization, alienation, turned the money into their actually disembodied or transﬁgured useful shape, thus making it the actual em-bodiment of their values. When they thus assume the shape of values, commodities strip off every trace of their natural and orig-inal use-values, and of the particular kind of useful labor to which they owe their cre-ation, in order to pupate into the homoge-neous social materialization of undifferentiated human labor. From the mere look of a piece of money we cannot tell what breed of commodity has been transformed into it. In their money-form all commodities look alike. Hence money may be dirt, although dirt is not money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will assume that the two golden coins in return for which our weaver has parted with her linen are the metamorphosed shape of a quarter of wheat. The sale of the linen, C − M, is at the same time its pur-chase, M −C.

altText:'<p>We&rsquo;ve just been lookin&rsquo; at how commodity owners trade the shit they make. Commodities can get made by anybody: it&rsquo;s who owns &lsquo;em that counts.

All that matters is ya own the commodity, which we all know has gotta get SysOptimized into money: the labor&rsquo;s automatically a ghost without a shell, an alien crashlanded from another planet who exploded on impact. But their tech stayed whole: and now we can sell it. This is all on the surface, ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; crazy: to make it in this world, ya gotta sell useful shit without needin&rsquo; to know how it got made.</p><p>So: we assign money to be some material: bits, gold, silver. In this case we&rsquo;re usin&rsquo; gold. How&rsquo;s it get into the market in the first place? Gotta get it from the source of production: where gold gets sold after it&rsquo;s made. What trades for gold? Something of equal value, some other commodity: an even barter style trade. Once that trade gets locked in: that&rsquo;s the price of the other commodity: and gold, like a virus, enters the market, ready to get spread all over. </p><p>Movin&rsquo; beyond the Gold Source, the gold&rsquo;s gotta be the same all over: lab certified clones, matchin&rsquo; certain physical stats. Goldminers&rsquo; job is to find and pile up those stats. once the goal&rsquo;s met, the material&rsquo;s ready for sale. Miningcorpo gets the sale: the gold becomes money. Shifted from somethin&rsquo; useful, somethin&rsquo; from nature, into a value measurer: somethin&rsquo; we dreamt up. This means it&rsquo;s gotta be Born from alien labor: totally separated from its producer, whose job was to make &lsquo;em all the same. </p><p>Money&rsquo;s gotta separate its history from its use. Needs to be subservient to its owner, measurin&rsquo; the value of whatever they need, strippin&rsquo; away the fat of use-values, while bein&rsquo; legitimately marked as gold: probs thru a serial number, an xxxclusive stamp.  Converts whatever needed into a zipped up pocket o&rsquo; Abstract Human Labor. To do this, it&rsquo;s gotta be the same all over.

M −C, the concluding phase of C −M −C (linen—money—Bible), is also C − M, the ﬁrst phase of C − M −C (Bible—money—brandy). Since the producer of the com-modity offers only a single product, he often sells it in large quantities, whereas the fact that he has many needs compels him to split up the price realized, the sum of money set free, into numerous purchases.

{text:'<p>If we now consider the completed metamorphosis of a commodity as a whole, we see in the ﬁrst place that it is made up of two opposite and complementary move-ments, C − M and M −C. These two an-tithetical transmutations of the commodity are accomplished through two antithetical social processes in which the commodity-owner takes part, and are reﬂected in the antithetical economic characteristics of the two processes. By taking part in the act of sale, the commodity-owner becomes a seller; in the act of purchase, he becomes a buyer. But just as, in every transmu-tation of a commodity, its two forms, the commodity-form and the money-form, exist simultaneously but at opposite poles, so ev-ery seller is confronted with a buyer, every buyer with a seller. While the same com-modity is successively passing through the two inverted transmutations, from a com-modity into money and from money into an-other commodity, the owner of the commod-ity successively changes his role from seller to buyer.

A commodity-owner is thus confronted with a money-owner. Now as soon as the commodity has been changed into money, the money becomes its van-ishing equivalent-form, whose use-value or content exists here on the spot, in the bod-ies of other commodities. Money, the ﬁ-nal stage of the ﬁrst transformation, is at the same time the starting-point for the second. The person who is a seller in the ﬁrst trans-action thus becomes a buyer in the second, in which a third commodity-owner comes to meet him as a seller.<sub><a href="#f3-71" class="black inline"><b>71</b></a></sub></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two inverted phases of the movement which makes up the metamor-phosis of a commodity constitute a circuit: commodity form, stripping off of this form, and return to it. Of course, the commod-ity itself is here subject to contradictory de-terminations. At the starting-point it is a non-use-value to its owner; at the end it is a use-value. So too the money appears in the ﬁrst phase as a solid crystal of value into which the commodity has been trans-formed, but afterwards it dissolves into the mere equivalent form of the commodity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

The orphan and the Gold Clonetroopers both exist at the same time, just on opposite sides of the Backroom. But behind those opposite sides, sits a buyer and a seller, watching the little fuckshow like a couple of pervos. While commodity owner&rsquo;s orphan gets gangbanged by the Clonetroopers, the commodity owner is a seller: cuz once that&rsquo;s done, they get to keep the Clonetroopers. Once the peepshow is over tho and the Clonetroopers exit the door on their side: suddenly they&rsquo;re a buyer. You only ever *buy* with Money. There is no Buying class and Selling class&ndash; instead, these roles migrate, solo to solo, as sex-crazed commodities circulate thru the Backrooms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marx is tryin&rsquo; to map out the way the orphan-money fuck train-sex kitten pipeline. There are 4 stages to the filthy commodity orgasm, while three pervos watch from behind the opposing Backdoors: the orphan-seller, the buyer, and the SexKitten-seller. The buildup first start when commodity meets the Gold Clonetroopers. This only happened cuz the commodity-owner and the money-owner met, and are standing on opposite sides of the seedy Backroom, peeping in thru the viewslots. Once enough Clonetroopers enter the room, Money successfully becomes the form of value for the commodity (i.e, the bukkakke can begin). The instant this protocol works and the commodity agrees with the amount of particpants, the commodity gets the Money-shot: it gets so covered in Money, that the seller accepts the Gold Clonetroopers as theirs, and the commodity, who they already didn&rsquo;t want, as… beyond their reach. The exhausted Money Clones exit the Backroom on the former-commodity owner&rsquo;s side, while the former-Money owner welcomes the freshly sticky commodity (who in their eyes, is the ultimate SexKitten). The squad of reloading Money Clones has SexMilitech on their side: they can connect to the bodies of other commodities, quickly set up a meet in another Backroom, and draw a meetup&ndash; all with raw JoyToy magnetism . </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See: the commodity always changes, but the fuck ritual is that same. A little orphan, owned and unwanted by a commodity-owner, set up a fling in a Backroom with a troop of amnesiac Gold Clones. But the orphan don&rsquo;t come back out, instead leaves the Gold Clones, with the commodity-owner as their new commander. They all go off to find a stimulatin&rsquo; SexKitten the commodity-owner actually wants to fuck. Once located, the Gold Clones go into another Backroom: this time, they pitifully disappear. &lsquo;Stead, out comes a hot little number from the musty smellin&rsquo; Backroom. Something actually wanted, ready for whatever&rsquo;s in store.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'},
{text:'<p>The two metamorphoses which constitute the commodity&rsquo;s circular path are at the same time two inverse partial meta-morphoses of two other commodities. One and the same commodity (the linen) opens the series of its own metamorphoses, and completes the metamorphosis of another (the wheat). In its ﬁrst transformation, the sale, the linen plays these two parts in its own person. But then it goes the way of all ﬂesh, enters the chrysalis state as gold, and thereby simultaneously completes the ﬁrst metamorphosis of a third commodity. Hence the circuit made by one commod-ity in the course of its metamorphoses is inextricably entwined with the circuits of other commodities. The process as a whole presents itself as the circulation of com-modities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The circulation of commodities differs from the direct barter of products not only in form, but in its essence. We have only to consider the course of events. The weaver has undoubtedly exchanged her linen for a Bible, her own commodity for someone else&rsquo;s. But this phenomenon is only true for her. The Bible pusher, who prefers a warming drink to cold sheets, had no intention of exchanging linen for his Bible; the weaver did not know that wheat had been exchanged for her linen. B&rsquo;s com-modity replaces that of A, but A and B do not mutually exchange their commodities. It may in fact happen that A and B buy from each other, but a particular relationship of this kind is by no means the necessary re-sult of the general conditions of the circu-lation of commodities. We see here, on the one hand, how the exchange of commodities breaks through all the individual and local limitations of the direct barter of products, and develops the metabolic process of hu-man labor. On the other hand, there devel-ops a whole network of social connections of natural origin, entirely beyond the con-trol of the human agents. Only because the farmer has sold his wheat is the weaver able to sell her linen, only because the weaver has sold her linen is our rash and intemper-ate friend able to sell his Bible, and only because the latter already has the water of everlasting life is the distiller able to sell his eau-de-vie. And so it goes on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
altText:'<p>Let&rsquo;s do a spotlight on the GoldClones the Owners recruited and gave up back there. The orphan, the Linen, went into a Backroom with the Gold Clones, who fucked it. The Gold Clones left the room from the Otherside, forced to act as shocktroops for the former LinenOwner (now a MoneyOwner) to get herself a SexKitten&ndash; somethin&rsquo; actually wanted, unlike their linen. These Gold Clones were owned by a former WheatFarmer, who owned another orphan, Wheat. She put her orphan in a different Backroom, and out came the Gold Clones that would later end up bein&rsquo; sold off to the LinenWeaver to get their orphan. You see: the Linen was the WheatFarmer&rsquo;s SexKitten: the orphan she actually wanted, unlike her wheat. Because of this, she gave up her shocktroops to a LinenWeaver. See how this works? The cycle of unwanted orphan to SexKitten is tied up into a network of Backroom switcheroos that overlap all the time. Marx calls this the circulation of commodities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This ain&rsquo;t barter: orphans aren&rsquo;t going into rooms with orphans and fuckin&rsquo; eachother. But in a way, you could fold the process into that. But in reality, the orphans/SexKittens never actually meet each other&ndash; all they ever know is an endless stream of exactly alike, big dick, long lastin&rsquo; Gold Shocktroopers. LinenWeaver gave up her unwanted orphan, Linen, for the SexKitten of her eye, a hottie who she will constantly use: the Holy Bible. The LinenWeaver&rsquo;s got no idea the Gold Shocktroopers she got came from a wheat sale. The WheatFarmer and the LinenWeaver never traded shit: but the WheatFarmer&rsquo;s commodity did, when folded up, replace the LinenWeaver&rsquo;s. Maybe there&rsquo;s a day when the LinenWeaver will actually wanna own the WheatFarmer&rsquo;s wheat, and the WheatFarmer will wanna own the LinenWeaver&rsquo;s linen, and they may use some Gold Shocktroopers to get this done. But that don&rsquo;t have to happen: they can just as easily never know the orphans the other doesn&rsquo;t want. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This gives us a fuckin&rsquo; incredible amount of power in gettin&rsquo; what we want: petty bullshit, stupid individualistic ideas get smashed in pursuit of chasin&rsquo; SexKittens other people don&rsquo;t want, and can easily be gotten if you got some Gold Shocktroopers. We, as solos, have huge access to whatever we want over an organized Network of Backrooms and JoyBeds. At the same time, the Network is totally out of our control. Causality rules: if that WheatFarmer didn&rsquo;t wanna give up her orphans, then the LinenWeaver wouldn&rsquo;t be able to give up her orphan with no buyer, meanin&rsquo; she&rsquo;d have no Gold Shocktroops to get that SexKitten the Holy Bible: and what if the BibleMaker don&rsquo;t wanna give up their precious little angel?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'},
{text:'<p id="c3-72">The circulation process, therefore, does not die down, as the direct barter does, with the change of places or change of hands of the use-values. When the money ﬁnally drops out of the series of metamorphoses undergone by a commodity, this does not mean that it vanishes. It always stays behind at a point in the arena of circulation vacated by the commodities. In the complete meta-morphosis of the linen, for example, linen—money—Bible, the linen ﬁrst falls out of circulation, and money steps into its place. Then the Bible falls out of circulation, and again money takes its place. When one com-modity replaces another, the money commodity always sticks to the hands of some third person.<sub><a href="#f3-72" class="black inline"><b>72</b></a></sub> Circulation sweats money from every pore. Nothing can be sillier than the dogma that, because every sale is a purchase and every purchase a sale, the circulation of commodities necessarily implies an equilib-rium between sales and purchases.</p><p>If this means that the number of actual sales accomplished is equal to the number of pur-chases, it is a ﬂat tautology. But it pur-ports to show that every seller brings his own buyer to market with him. Nothing of the kind.</p><p>Sale and purchase constitute one identical act, as an interaction between two persons assuming opposite roles like two poles, the commodity owner and the money owner.</p><p>They constitute two acts of polar and oppo-site characters when carried out by one and the same person.</p><p>The identity of sale and purchase implies therefore that the commodity is useless if, on being thrown into the alchemistical retort of circulation, it does not come out again in the shape of money, i.e., if it is not sold by the commodity owner, i.e., bought by the money owner.</p><p>That identity further implies that the pro-cess, if it reaches fruition, constitutes a point of rest, an interval, long or short, in the life of the commodity. Since the ﬁrst meta-morphosis of a commodity is at once a sale and a purchase, this partial process is at the same time an independent process in itself. The buyer has the commodity, the seller has the money, i.e., a commodity which remains in a form capable of circulating, whether it reappears on the market at an earlier or later date.</p><p>No one can sell unless someone else pur-chases. But no one is forwith bound to pur-chase, because he has just sold. Circulation bursts through all the temporal, spatial, and individual barriers imposed by the direct exchange of products, and it does this by splitting up the direct identity present in the barter between the exchange of one&rsquo;s own product and the acquisition of someone else&rsquo;s into the two antithetical segments of sale and purchase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

They basically took the place of the now homebound SexKitten. Sticky and sweaty: they gotta listen to their new commander, their owner. This Backroom system is built on milking Gold Clonetroopers dry.

Part of a bigger process, meanin&rsquo; the fuckshow that lead to the truelove was really just one part of a story beyond the truelove.

{text:'<p>Hence the form of motion directly imparted on money by the circulation of commodi-ties is that of a constant removal from its starting-point, a movement from the hands of one commodity-owner into those of the next. This path we will call its ﬂow (cur-rency, cours de la monnaie).</p><p>The circulation of money shows the constant and monotonous repetition of the same process. The commodity is al-ways in the hands of the seller; the money, as a means of purchase, always in the hands of the buyer. It functions as means of pur-chase by realizing the price of the commod-ity. While realizing the commodity&rsquo;s price, it transfers the commodity from the seller to the buyer and at the same time removes itself from the hands of the buyer into those of the seller. There, it repeats the same pro-cess with a different commodity. The ori-gin of this one-sided form of motion of the money in the two-sided progression of the commodity through its forms is hidden from view.</p><p id="c3-74">The very nature of the commodity circula-tion produces a semblance of the opposite of itself. The ﬁrst metamorphosis of a com-modity is visible not only as the money&rsquo;s movement, but also as that of the commod-ity itself; its second metamorphosis, how-ever is only visible as the movement of the money. In the ﬁrst phase of its circula-tion the commodity changes places with the money. Thereupon the commodity, in its shape as an object of utility, falls out of circulation into consumption.<sub><a href="#f3-74" class="black inline"><b>74</b></a></sub> Its value-shape or monetary larva steps into its shoes. It then passes through the second phase of its circulation, no longer in its own natural skin, but in its gold skin.</p><p id="c3-75">With this, the continuity of the movement lies entirely with the money, and the same movement which, for the commodity, in-cludes two opposite processes, is, when considered as the movement of the money, always one and the same process, a con-stant change of places with commodities that are always different. Hence the result of the circulation of commodities, namely the replacement of one commodity by an-other, appears not to have been mediated by its own change of form, but rather by the function of money as means of circulation. As means of circulation, money circulates commodities, which in and for themselves lack the power of movement, and transfers them from hands in which they are non-use-values into hands in which they are use-values; and this process always takes the op-posite direction to the path of the commodi-ties themselves. Money constantly removes commodities from the sphere of circulation, by constantly stepping into their place in cir-culation, and in this way continually moving away from its own starting-point. Hence al-though the movement of money is merely the expression of the circulation of com-modities, the situation appears as the reverse of this, namely the circulation of commodi-ties appears as the result of the movement of money.<sub><a href="#f3-75" class="black inline"><b>75</b></a></sub></p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

{text:'<p>On the other hand, money obtains the function of means of circulation only because in it the value possessed by com-modities has taken on an independent shape.

This fact must therefore make itself plainly visible in the circulation of money.</p><p>Thus the linen, for instance, ﬁrst of all changes its commodity-form into its money form. The ﬁnal term of its ﬁrst metamor-phosis C − M, the money form, then becomes the ﬁrst term of its ﬁnal metamor-phosis M −C, its transformation back into the shape of the Bible. But each of these two changes of form is accomplished by an exchange between commodity and money, by their reciprocal displacement. The same pieces of coin come into the seller&rsquo;s hand as the alienated form of the commodity and leave it as the commodity in its absolutely alienable form. They are displaced twice. The ﬁrst metamorphosis of the linen puts these coins into the weaver&rsquo;s pocket, the second draws them out of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two opposite changes undergone by the same commodity are therefore reﬂected in the displacement, twice repeated but in op-posite directions, of the same pieces of coin.</p><p>If however only a one-sided me-tamorphosis takes place, if there are only sales or only purchases, then a given piece of money changes its place only once. Its second change of place always expresses the second metamorphosis of the commod-ity, its reconversion from money.

Money, on the contrary, as the medium of circulation, resides in the sphere of cir-culation and constantly moves around in it. The question therefore arises of how much money this sphere constantly absorbs.</p><p>In a given country there take place every day at the same time, though in differ-ent places, numerous one-sided metamor-phoses of commodities; in other words, sim-ple sales on one hand, simple purchases on the other.

{text:'<p>And since, in the direct form of circulation being con-sidered here, money and commodities al-ways come into physical confrontation with each other, one at the positive pole of pur-chase, the other at the negative pole of sale, it is clear that the amount of means of circu-lation required is determined beforehand by the sum of the prices of all these commodi-ties. As a matter of fact, the money is only the representation in real life of the quantity of gold previously expressed in the imagi-nation by the sum of the prices of the com-modities. It is therefore self-evident that these two quantities are equal.</p><p>We know however that, the val-ues of commodities remaining constant, their prices vary with the value of gold (the material of money), rising in proportion as it falls, and falling in proportion as it rises. Given that the sum of the prices of com-modities falls or rises in this way, it follows that the quantity of money in circulation must fall or rise to the same extent. This change in the quantity of the circulating medium is certainly caused by the money itself, yet not in virtue of its function as a medium of circulation, but rather in virtue of its function as a measure of value. First the price of the commodities varies inversely as the value of the money, and then the quantity of the medium of circulation varies directly as the price of the commodities.</p><p>Exactly the same phenomenon would arise if, for instance, instead of the value of gold falling, silver were to replace it as the mea-sure of value, or if, instead of the value of silver rising, it were to be driven out of its function as measure of value by gold. In the one case, more silver would be in circula-tion than there was previously gold, and in the other case, less gold would be in circu-lation than there was previously silver. In each case the value of the money material, i.e. the value of the commodity serving as the measure of value, would have undergone a change, and so too, therefore, would the prices of commodities which express their values in money, as well as the quantity of money which would need to be in circula-tion to realize those prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have already seen that the sphere of cir-culation has a hole in it, through which gold (or silver, or the money material in general) enters as a commodity with a given value. Hence, when money begins to function as a measure of value, when it is used to deter-mine prices, its value is presupposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

In other words&ndash; get their prices. add up all the orphans&rsquo; Fucktrain limits; get amount of Gold Clones needed for sysfunction. change in the value of clone troopers causes Fucktrain limits to change too.

{text:'<p>If that value falls, the fall ﬁrst shows itself in a change in the prices of those commodities which are directly exchanged with the pre-cious metals at their source. The greater part of all other commodities, especially at the less developed stages of bourgeois society, will continue for a long time to be estimated in terms of the former value of the measure of value, which has now become antiquated and illusory. Nevertheless, one commodity infects another through their common value relation, so that their prices, expressed in gold or silver, gradually settle down into the proportions determined by their compar-ative values, until ﬁnally the values of all commodities are estimated in terms of the new value of the monetary metal. This pro-cess of equalization is accompanied by a continued increase in the quantity of the pre-cious metals, owing to the inﬂux needed to replace the commodities directly exchanged with them. In proportion therefore as the adjusted prices of the commodities become general, in proportion as their values come to be estimated according to the new value of the metal (which has fallen and may, up to a certain point, continue to fall), in that same proportion does the increased mass of metal which is necessary for the realization of the new prices become available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A one-sided observation of the events which followed the discovery of fresh supplies of gold and silver led some people in the sev-enteenth and more particularly in the eigh-teenth century to the false conclusion that the prices of commodities had risen because there was more gold and silver acting as the means of circulation. Henceforth we shall assume the value of gold as a given factor, as in fact it is if we take it at the moment when we estimate the price of a commodity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On this assumption, then, the quantity of the medium of circulation is de-termined by the sum of the prices to be real-ized. If we now further assume that the price of each commodity is given, the sum of the prices clearly depends on the total amount of commodities found in circulation. We do not need to rack our brains to grasp that if our quarter of wheat costs £2, 100 quarters will cost £200, 200 quarters £400, and so on, and therefore that the quantity of money which changes places with the wheat, when it is sold, must increase as the quantity of the wheat increases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

But eventually, like a computer virus, the great Settling, as the new flux of fast made Clones start makin&rsquo; fuck limits increase, will happen cross the board. Why? Value relation&rsquo;s gotta hold&ndash; the value of gold&rsquo;s measured by the socially necessary labor time. Remember&ndash; that&rsquo;s average labor time it takes to make it. New data changes the average. Means a batch of fast mined gold&rsquo;s gonna affect the value of every clone, everywhere, depending on how much gold gets pumped in and how fast it was made.

{text:'<p>If the mass of commodities remains constant, the quantity of money in circu-lation surges up or down according to the ﬂuctuations in the prices of the commodi-ties. It rises and falls because the sum of the prices increases or diminishes as a result of the change of price. For this it is by no means necessary that the prices of all com-modities should rise or fall simultaneously. A rise or a fall in the prices of a number of leading articles is sufﬁcient in the one case to increase, in the other to diminish, the sum of the prices of all commodities, and there-fore to put more or less money in circula-tion. Whether the change in the price re-ﬂects an actual change in the value of the commodities, or merely ﬂuctuations in their market prices, the effect on the quantity of the medium of circulation remains the same. </p><p id="c3-76">Let us assume that there occur a number of unconnected and simultane-ous sales, or partial metamorphoses, in dif-ferent localities, sales of, say, 1 quarter of wheat, 20 yards of linen, 1 Bible and 4 gal-lons of brandy. If the price of each article is £2, and the sum of the prices to be real-ized is consequently £8, it follows that £8 in money must enter into circulation. If, on the other hand, these same articles are links in the following chain of metamorphoses: 1 quarter of wheat—£2—20 yards of linen—£2—1 Bible—£2—4 gallons of brandy—£2, a chain which is already well known to us, in that case the £2 causes the different commodities to circulate after realizing their prices successively, and therefore realizing the sum of those prices, which is £8, the £2 ﬁnally comes to rest in the hands of the dis-tiller. The £2 has turned over four times. It has performed four acts of circulation. This repeated change of place of the same pieces of money corresponds to the double change of form undergone by the commodities, it corresponds to their movement through two diametrically opposed stages of circulation, and the intertwining of the metamorphoses of different commodities.<sub><a href="#f3-76" class="black inline"><b>76</b></a></sub> These antithet-ical and mutually complementary phases, through which the process passes, cannot take place alongside each other. They must follow in temporal succession. It is seg-ments of time therefore which form the measure of the duration of the process, in other words, the velocity of the circulation of money is measured by the number of times the same piece of money turns over within a given period. Suppose the process of circulation of the four articles takes a day. The sum of prices to be realized is £8, the number of times the £2 turns over during the day is four, and the quantity of money in circulation is £2. Hence, for a given inter-val of time during the process of circulation, we have the following equation: the quan-tity of money functioning as the circulating medium = the sum of the prices of the com-modities divided by the number of times coins of the same denomination turn over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

{text:'<p>This law holds generally. The process of circulation in a given country is made up, on the one hand, of numerous isolated and simultaneous partial metamor-phoses, sales (and purchases) running paral-lel to each other in which each coin changes its position only once, or performs only one act of circulation, on the other hand, it is made up of many distinct series of meta-morphoses, partly running parallel, partly coalescing with each other, and in each of these series each coin turns over a num-ber of times. How often each coin turns over varies according to the circumstances. Given the total number of times all the circu-lating coins of one denomination turn over, we can arrive at the average number of times a single coin turns over, or, in other words, the average velocity of circulation of money.</p><p>The quantity of money thrown into the pro-cess of circulation at the beginning of each day is of course determined by the sum of the prices of all the commodities circulat-ing simultaneously and side by side. But within that process coins are, so to speak, made responsible for each other. If one in-creases its velocity of circulation, the other slows down or completely leaves the sphere of circulation. This is because the sphere of circulation can absorb only the amount of gold which, multiplied by the average num-ber of times its basic unit turns over, is equal to the sum of prices to be realized. Hence, if the number of acts of circulation performed by the separate pieces increases, the total number of those pieces in circulation dimin-ishes. If the number of acts of circulation diminishes, the total number of pieces in-creases. Since the quantity of money which can function as means of circulation is ﬁxed for a given average velocity of circulation, one has only to throw a given quantity of£1 notes into circulation in order to extract the same number of sovereigns from it. This trick is well known to all banks. Just as the ﬂow of money is in gen-eral merely a reﬂection of the process of cir-culation of commodities, i.e. their circular path through diametrically opposed meta-morphoses, so too the velocity of circu-lation of money is merely a reﬂection of the rapidity with which commodities change their forms, the continuous interlocking of the series of metamorphoses, the hurried nature of society&rsquo;s metabolic process, the quick disappearance of commodities from the sphere of circulation, and their equally quick replacement by fresh commodities. In the velocity of circulation, therefore, there appears the ﬂuid unity of the antithetical and complementary phases, i.e. the transfor-mation of the commodities from the form of utility into the form of value and their re-transformation in the reverse direction, or the two processes of sale and purchase. Inversely, when the circulation of money slows down, the two processes become sep-arated, they assert their independence and mutual antagonism; stalling occurs in the form changes and hence in the metabolic process. The circulation itself, of course, gives no clue to the origin of this stalling; it merely presents us with the phenomenon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
altText:'<p>Time X Space. Can&rsquo;t just look at one high noon, and all the money that entered circulation. Nah: follow the money too, see how many links in its chain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With turnover, we see circulation can&rsquo;t funct as one high noon.

But why do that: HoloClones mix in fine with the others. Thing is: HoloClones are technically counted as part of the Clone Army. And since Citibank can increase the amount of clones circulating with these cheap HoloClones, some amount of real GoldClones can get kicked outta the Army. Meaning: CitiBank can add HoloClones to the System, and keep real GoldClones under lockdown,  with no harm done.

The fact that the circulation of money itself splits the nominal content of coins away from their real content, dividing their metallic existence from their functional existence, this fact latently implies the pos-sibility of replacing metallic money with to-kens made of some other material, i.e. sym-bols which would perform the function of coins.</p><p>The technical obstacles to coining extremely minute quantities of gold or silver, and the circumstance that at ﬁrst the less precious metal is used as a measure of value instead of the more precious, copper instead of sil-ver, silver instead of gold, and that the less precious circulates as money until dethroned by the more precious—these facts provide a historical explanation for the role played by silver and copper tokens as substitutes for gold coins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
altText:'<p>Since gold&rsquo;s the way gonks in Marxy&rsquo;s day measured value, all prices get the gold price unit. This has gotta be human usable shit- gotta use open comms that anyone can patch into. In other words: a coin. When Marxy says a coin, think of a coin made of gold. When he brings up token of value, it&rsquo;s a coin that ain&rsquo;t made of gold.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marxy finally brings up the fact that countries back then had different coins you could only buy shit with in that specific country. The thing is, with the gold standard, all countries took gold as bein&rsquo; able to be converted into coins of that country. So the coins and the gold were related, since you couldn&rsquo;t do that frak with any other commodity. Coins ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but a meatspaced clone army flyin&rsquo; a specific national flag, which they got once they fucked a boiled down chunk of themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That chunk gets boiled down at National Clone Farm, to be made into these National Coin Army type Clones. But the warpath once a Coin gets out of the National clone Farm&rsquo;s actually back to  the Clone Farm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gold Coins ain&rsquo;t in dreamland: they&rsquo;re meatspaced, so as they&rsquo;re let loose on the market, no umbilical cord, they lose weight as they move from owner to owner. Less able to fuck: less able to be the measure of value. Thing is, all Gold Clones are supposed to be just that: clones. They&rsquo;re supposed to fuck the same as any other clone: always.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The material circulating wasn&rsquo;t matching up to the thing money was supposed to be doing: being a tool to measure value, since the money was literally falling apart. State wanted to find tokens, holograms that could act as reps for gold. Gold was too valuable to send on the front lines now: if even a little bit got wasted in circulation, that was lost business right there. The State had a more important job to do: get the people to ignore how good a gold clone can fuck. Just pay attention to the circulation part of money, and not that it accurately measures value. This way, it can move through the Backrooms fast. This made the State switch to coins that weren&rsquo;t made of gold: coins that it could afford to lose material on, cheap shit. Gold Coins became Copper and silver coins, who couldn&rsquo;t fuck nearly as good, but were labelled as bein&rsquo; able to, bein&rsquo; vouched for by the now armchaired Gold Army soldiers. And it worked: cuz the orphan owners didn&rsquo;t care about pleasing commodities in the Backroom- they just wanted their SexKittens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'},
{text:'<p id="c3-82">Silver and copper coins re-place gold in those regions of the circula-tion of commodities where coins pass from hand to hand most rapidly, and are there-fore worn out most quickly. This happens where sales and purchases on a very small scale recur unceasingly. In order to prevent these satellites from establishing themselves permanently in the place of gold, the law determines the very minute proportions in which alone they can be accepted as alter-native payment. The particular tracks pur-sued by the different sorts of coin in circu-lation naturally run into each other. Small change appears alongside gold for the payment of fractional parts of the smallest gold coin; gold constantly enters into retail circu-lation, although it is just as constantly being thrown out again by being exchanged with small change.<sub><a href="#f3-82" class="black inline"><b>82</b></a></sub></p><p>The metallic content of silver and copper tokens is arbitrarily determined by law. ln the course of circulation they wear down even more rapidly than gold coins. Their function as coins is therefore in prac-tice entirely independent of their weight, i.e. it is independent of all value. In its form of existence as coin, gold becomes completely divorced from the substance of its value. Relatively valueless objects, therefore, such as paper notes, can serve as coins in place of gold. This purely symbolic character of the currency is still somewhat disguised in the case of metal tokens. In paper money it stands out plainly.</p><p>One sees: only the ﬁrst step matters.</p><p id="c3-83">Here we are concerned only with inconvertible paper money issued by the state and given forced currency. This money emerges directly out of the circulation of metallic money. Credit money on the other hand implies relations which are as yet to-tally unknown, from the standpoint of the simple circulation of commodities. But it may be noted in passing that just as true paper money arises out of the function of money as the circulating medium, so does credit-money take root spontaneously in the function of money as the means of pay-ment.<sub><a href="#f3-83" class="black inline"><b>83</b></a></sub></p><p>Pieces of paper on which money names are printed, such as £ 1, £ 5, etc., are thrown into the circulation process from outside by the state. In so far as they actually circulate in the place of the same amount of gold, their movement is simply a reﬂection of the laws of monetary circulation itself. The speciﬁc laws obeyed by paper circula-tion can only spring from its relation to gold, since it is the representative of gold.</p><p>This law is simply that the issue of paper money must be restricted to that quantity in which the gold (or silver) which it symbol-izes would actually have to be in circulation.</p><p> Now it is true that the quantity of gold which can be absorbed by the sphere of circulation constantly ﬂuctuates above and below a cer-tain average level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
altText:'<p>So these weak cock replacements take over the places where gold clones got rode the hardest, wasted away the quickest- where cheap shit is sold, like sticks of chewing gum, applets, ministims. </p><p>Thing is, the Law doesn&rsquo;t want to dethrone gold. They want less limpdicked coppers around than gold coins, this way people will be able to pay with gold coins for cheap shit, and get back change. Good way to keep shit flowing and avoid ya needin&rsquo; sacks of pennies to buy an oz of Stim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the amount of clones in existence, the amount of metal in coppers is decided by the State. Since coppers&rsquo;re designed to be slapjob, supposed to be wasted away for too much use, the metal injection ain&rsquo;t important. Might as well be 99% scrap, 1% copper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gold clones too. When they become coins, get &rsquo;emselves derezzed, mogged into a limping husk, drained of itself: they don&rsquo;t even need to be made of metal anymore. This is how we get paper money- the logical conclusion to the value race to the bottom that comes with usin&rsquo; the gold standard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we ain&rsquo;t talkin&rsquo; about credit money here. That shit&rsquo;s out of order peekin&rsquo; its head around the corner just yet, we haven&rsquo;t cracked this data fortress quite yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All we get now is that credit money gets its use because money&rsquo;s got the job as the means of payment, so credit money might show up to spin its own cryptowebs.</p><p>So: how much gold money can get replaced by paper money? Marxy says the State pumps in paper money, not knowin&rsquo; if people will be game to actually use it. For instance, what happens if the State pumps the whole System with *too* much paper money. Well, buyers&rsquo;ll try to get rid of their cash ASAP, since they got so much of it. Monetarists, libs who think it&rsquo;s the money in circulation that sets price, think this supports their theory. It actually looks like it might: the money supply is now increasing the owner switch velocity, which should increase the prices or quantity of commodities. Thing is- money owners don&rsquo;t decide the value and the amount of money circulating. They aren&rsquo;t in charge of printing: the State is. And paper money has a job: to rep a certain amount of gold in the Auth&rsquo;s supply. Too much paper money means each paper clone represents the gold supply a little less- which is the same as if prices went up with a drop in value in gold. But wait. Earlier, didn&rsquo;t we say the money supply is variable, always changin&rsquo; as prices, velocity, or number of commodities change?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'},
{text:'<p>But despite this, the mass of the circulat-ing medium in a given country never sinks below a certain minimum, which can be ascertained by experience. The fact that this minimum mass continually undergoes changes in its constituent parts, or that the pieces of gold of which it consists are con-stantly being replaced by other pieces, does of course not make a differece to its extent or to the continuity with which it remains in the sphere of circulation. It can therefore be replaced by paper symbols.</p><p id="c3-84">If however all the channels of circulation were today ﬁlled with paper money to the full extent of their capacity for absorbing money, they might the next day be over-full owing to the ﬂuctuations in the circulation of commodities. There would no longer be any standard. If the paper money exceeds its proper limit, i.e., the amount of gold coins of the same denomination which could have been in circulation, then, quite apart from the danger of becoming generally discred-ited, it will still represent within the world of commodities only that quantity of gold which is ﬁxed by its immanent laws. No greater quantity is capable of being repre-sented. If the quantity of paper money rep-resents twice the amount of gold available, then in practice £1 will be the money-name not of 1/4 of an ounce of gold, but 1/8 of an ounce. The effect is the same as if an alter-ation had taken place in the function of gold as the standard of prices. The values pre-viously expressed by the price of £1 would now be expressed by the price of £2. Paper money is a symbol of gold, a symbol of money. Its relation to the values of commodities consists only in this: they ﬁnd imaginary expression in certain quan-tities of gold, and the same quantities are symbolically and physically represented by the paper. Only in so far as paper money represents gold, which like all other com-modities has value, is it a symbol of value.<sub><a href="#f3-84" class="black inline"><b>84</b></a></sub></p><p>Finally, one may ask why gold is capable of being replaced by valueless symbols of itself.</p><p>As we have already seen, it is capable of be-ing replaced in this way only if its function as coin or circulating medium can be singled out or rendered independent. Now this func-tion of being the circulating medium does not attain an independent position as far as the individual gold coins are concerned, al-though that independent position does ap-pear in the case of the continued circulation of abraded coins. A piece of money is a mere coin, or means of circulation, only as long as it is actually in circulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
altText:'<p>Marxy tells States that they can&rsquo;t issue more paper money than the minimum amount of circulation&rsquo; medium.See: gold clone circulation never goes under a particular number, which the State can figure out through a Sys-analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What happens if you go over this number? Every flux in commodity circulation is gonna make the cash inflated. No more standard. Paper money is supposed to solely be a rep for gold. If you got too many poser assholes claimin&rsquo; they got gold&rsquo;s abilities, the people jump on &lsquo;em, pushin&rsquo; &lsquo;em to a broken limit they lied they could match: you get runaway inflation. The people are gonna figure it out once prices rise to meet the true amount of gold a single paper note reps, and then try for a foreign agent, who can better rep the gold.

Bein&rsquo; precious and being made to wear down? How can one thing do both? The question unlocks the ability for worthless paper to sub in for gold. The question brianhacks the deckheads in the System. They start singling out the circulating application of gold coins. Gold coins *are* precious: why the fuck would I WANT to spend &lsquo;em. Hoarders appear,  gold clone commanders who know the value of their gold, so they keep &lsquo;em out of circulation, starting the sequence of the replacement of the gold that *is* in circulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'},
{text:'<p id="c3-85">But what is not valid for the individual gold coin is valid for that minimum mass of gold which is capable of being replaced by pa-per money. That mass constantly dwells in the sphere of circulation, continually func-tions as a circulating medium, and there-fore exists exclusively as the bearer of this function. Its movement therefore represents nothing but the continued alternation of the inverse phases of the metamorphosis C − M − C, phases in which the commodity&rsquo;s shape as a value confronts it only to disap-pear again immediately. The representation of the exchange-value of a commodity as an independent entity is here only a transient aspect of the process. The commodity is im-mediately replaced again by another commodity. Hence in this process which contin-ually makes money pass from hand to hand, it only needs to lead a symbolic existence. Its functional existence so to speak absorbs its material existence. Since it is a tran-siently objectiﬁed reﬂection of the prices of commodities, it serves only as symbol of it-self, and can therefore be replaced by an-other symbol.<sub><a href="#f3-85" class="black inline"><b>85</b></a></sub></p><p>One thing is necessary, however: the sym-bol of money must have its own objective social validity. The paper acquires this by its forced currency. The state&rsquo;s compulsion can only be of any effect within that inter-nal sphere of circulation which is circum-scribed by the boundaries of a given com-munity, but it is also only within that sphere that money is completely absorbed in its function as medium of circulation, and is therefore able to receive, in the form of pa-per money, a purely functional mode of ex-istence in which it is externally separated from its metallic substance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

{text:'<p>Let us return to the sphere of cir-culation. The two equivalents, commodities and money, have ceased to appear simulta-neously at the two poles of the process of sale. The money functions now, ﬁrst as a measure of value in the determination of the price of the commodity sold; the price ﬁxed by contract measures the obligation of the buyer, i.e. the sum of money he owes at a particular time. Secondly it serves as a no-tional means of purchase. Although it exists only in the promise of the buyer to pay, it causes the commodity to change hands. Not until payment falls due does the means of payment actually step into circulation, i.e. leave the hand of the buyer for that of the seller.</p><p>The circulating medium was transformed into a hoard because the process stopped short after the ﬁrst phase, because the con-verted shape of the commodity was with-drawn from circulation.

It brings it to an end by an independent act, as the absolute form of existence of exchange-value, i.e., as the universal commodity.</p><p id="c3-98">The seller turned his commodity into money in order to satisfy some need; the hoarder in order to preserve the monetary form of his commodity, and the indebted purchaser in order to be able to pay.

The buyer converts money back into commodities before he has turned com-modities into money: in other words, he achieves the second metamorphosis of com-modities before the ﬁrst. The seller&rsquo;s com-modity circulates, but it realizes its price only as a title to money in civil law. It is converted into a use-value before it has been converted into money.

{text:'<p>The obligations falling due within a given time period represent the sum of the prices of the commodities whose sale gave rise to these obligations. The quantity of money necessary to realize this sum de-pends in the ﬁrst instance on the turnover speed of the means of payment. This speed is conditioned by two factors: ﬁrst, the way in which relations between creditors and debtors interlock, as when A receives money from B, who is in debt to him, and then pays it out to his creditor C, and second, the length of time between the days in which the various obligations fall due. </p><p>The chain of successive payments, i.e., re-tarded ﬁrst metamorphoses, differs essen-tially from the interlacing of the metamor-phosis-sequences which we considered on a former page. The movement of the (money functioning as) means of circulation is more than a mere expression of the connection be-tween buyers and sellers. This connection itself only originates by and together with the movement of money. Contrariwise, the movement of the means of payment is the expression of a social relation which is al-ready complete and in existence before the money begins to move.</p><p>Since sales take place simultane-ously and side by side, the extent to which the turnover speed can make up for the quantity of currency available is limited. On the other hand, this simultaneity gives a new impulse towards the economical use of the means of payment. With the concentration of payments in one place, special institu-tions and methods of liquidation develop spontaneously. For instance, the virements (clearing houses) in medieval Lyons. The debts due to A from B, to B from C, to C from A, and so on, have only to be brought face to face in order to cancel each other out, to a certain extent, as positive and neg-ative amounts. There remains only a single debit balance to be settled. The greater the concentration of the payments, the less is this balance in relation to the total amount, hence the less is the mass of the means of payment in circulation.</p><p>The function of money as means of payment contains an unmediated contra-diction. As long as the payments balance each other, money functions only notion-ally, as money of account or as measure of value. But if actual payments have to be made, money does not come onto the scene as a means of circulation, as a merely transient and intermediary form of the social metabolism, but as the individual incarna-tion of social labor, the independent exis-tence of exchange-value, the absolute com-modity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

An archivist by nature, the Clearing House mentats and stores away all debts owed by all parties in a zone, til they get paid off. Shit gets made too slow (the Cycle time), and since trades are just a promise, the Clearing House can keep track of who ordered what before it got paid for.

Whenever there is a general disturbance of the mechanism, no matter what its cause, money suddenly and immediately changes over from its merely notional shape, money of account, into hard cash. Profane com-modities can no longer replace it. The use-value of commodities becomes valueless, and their value vanishes in the face of its own value form. The bourgeois, drunk with prosperity and arrogantly certain of him-self, has just declared that money is a purely imaginary creation. &lsquo;Commodities alone are money,&rsquo; he said. But now the opposite cry resounds over the markets of the world: only money is a commodity. As the heart pants after fresh water, so pants the soul of the bourgeois after money, the only wealth.<sub><a href="#f3-100" class="black inline"><b>100</b></a></sub> In a crisis, the antithesis between commodi-ties and their value form, money, is raised to the level of an absolute contradiction. Hence money&rsquo;s form of appearance is here also a matter of indifference. The monetary famine remains whether payments have to be made in gold or in credit-money, such as bank-notes.<sub><a href="#f3-100" class="black inline"><b>100</b></a></sub></p><p id="c3-102">If we now consider the total amount of money in circulation during a given pe-riod, we ﬁnd that, for any given turnover rate of the medium of circulation and the means of payment, it is equal to the sum of prices to be realized, plus the sum of the payments falling due, minus the payments which bal-ance each other out, and, ﬁnally, minus the number of circuits in which the same piece of coin serves alternately as medium of cir-culation and means of payment. The farmer, for example, sells his wheat for £2, and this money serves thus as the medium of circu-lation. On the day when the payment falls due, he uses it to pay for linen which the weaver has delivered. The same £2 now serves as the means of payment. The weaver now buys a Bible for cash. This serves again as the medium of circulation, and so on. Therefore, even when prices, speed of mon-etary circulation and economies in the use of the means of payment are given, the quan-tity of money in circulation no longer cor-responds with the mass of commodities in circulation during a given period, such as a day. Money which represents commodities long since withdrawn from circulation con-tinues to circulate. Commodities circulate, but their equivalent in money does not ap-pear until some future date. Moreover, the debts contracted each day, and the payments falling due on the same day, are entirely in-commensurable magnitudes.<sub><a href="#f3-102" class="black inline"><b>102</b></a></sub></p>',

{text:'<p><a href="#c3-50" class="black"><b>50.</b></a> The question why money does not directly represent labor-time itself, so that a piece of pa-per may represent, for instance, x labor hours, comes down simply to the question why, on the basis of commodity production, the products of labor must take the form of commodities, since their assuming the form of commodities implies their differentiation into commodities on the one hand and the money commodity on the other. It is the question why private labor cannot be treated as its opposite, directly social labor. Elsewhere I have given an exhaustive discussion of the shal-low utopianism of the idea of &lsquo;labor money&rsquo; in a society founded on the production of commodi-ties (op. cit., p. 320:2&ndash;321:4 ff.)</p><p>&ldquo;John Gray was the first to set forth the theory that labour-time is the direct measure of money in a systematic way. He proposes that a national central bank should ascertain through its branches the labour-time expended in the production of various commodities. In exchange for the commodity, the producer would receive an official certificate of its value, i.e., a receipt for as much labour-time as his commodity contains, and this bank-note of one labour week, one labour day, one labour hour, etc., would serve at the same time as an order to the bank to hand over an equivalent in any of the other commodities stored in its warehouses. This is the basic principle, which is scrupulously worked out in detail and modelled throughout on existing English institutions. Gray says that under this system &ldquo;to sell for money may be rendered, at all times, precisely as easy as it now is to buy with money, ... production would become the uniform and never-failing cause of demand.&rdquo; The precious metals would lose their &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; position in comparison with other commodities and &ldquo;take their proper place in the market beside butter and eggs, and cloth and calico, and then the value of the precious metals will concern us just as little ... as the value of the diamond.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',altText:'<p id="f3-50">The number Money gives us ain&rsquo;t the commodity&rsquo;s value&ndash;it&rsquo;s the price: how much Gold you&rsquo;ll get for the commodity you&rsquo;re sellin&rsquo;. That ain&rsquo;t a reflection of its value: value&rsquo;s measured by labor-time, not by an equivalent form. But, say commodities had a labor-time tag attached to &lsquo;em instead of a price. That brings up a bigger question: why are they still bein&rsquo; made as commodities? Like, to get labor-time, ya gotta know the socially necessary labor-time: you gotta know the output speed of every individual producer makin&rsquo; the commodity, and average out by commodity. </p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a sec and read what Marxy had to say about those utopian gonks that think we can keep commodities  but &ldquo;get rid&rdquo; of Money by subbin&rsquo; in labor-time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Johnny Gray wants a Computer Program attached to a Central Bank to calc the value of all commodities. This way, price and value are the same&ndash; there&rsquo;s no Middleman anymore, no King Gold. But as long as commodities are around, somebody&rsquo;s gotta be Middlemen&ndash; remember, it&rsquo;s the commodity&rsquo;s relations that decide exchange, not ours. People still make shit privately, and produce commodities to jack into the Exchange Loop and get an equivalent&ndash; in this case, &ldquo;LABOR MONEY&rdquo; (L-Bucks). Blockchained certificate with the value of the thing you&rsquo;re sellin&rsquo; made human readable. You can take your L-bucks and spend &lsquo;em on things that cost the same amount of L-Bucks. It&rsquo;d be the *most* accurate &ldquo;price&rdquo;&ndash; the value. Program found the socially necessary labor-time by aggregatin&rsquo; all previous Exchanges. The same logic of the Exchange Loop is there: Owners still got the incentive to sell somethin&rsquo; with high value that *you*, individually, made faster than the SNLT. This way, you use up less labor-power, meanin&rsquo; less of the value you get back needs to go to subsistence, and you can spend the rest on shit ya want or to expand production. No more privileges to gold, diamonds, stores of value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since labour-time is the intrinsic measure of value, why use another extraneous standard as well? Why is exchange-value transformed into price? Why is the value of all commodities computed in terms of an exclusive commodity, which thus becomes the adequate expression of exchange-value, i.e., money? This was the problem which Gray had to solve. But instead of solving it, he assumed that commodities could be directly compared with one another as products of social labour. But they are only comparable as the things they are. Commodities are the direct products of isolated independent individual kinds of labour, and through their alienation in the course of individual exchange they must prove that they are general social labour, in other words, on the basis of commodity production, labour becomes social labour only as a result of the universal alienation of individual kinds of labour. But as Gray presupposes that the labour-time contained in commodities is immediately social labour-time, he presupposes that it is communal labour-time or labour-time of directly associated individuals. In that case, it would indeed be impossible for a specific commodity, such as gold or silver, to confront other commodities as the incarnation of universal labour and exchange-value would not be turned into price; but neither would use-value be turned into exchange-value and the product into a commodity, and thus the very basis of bourgeois production would be abolished. But this is by no means what Gray had in mind &ndash; goods are to be produced as commodities but not exchanged as commodities. Gray entrusts the realisation of this pious wish to a national bank. On the one hand, society in the shape of the bank makes the individuals independent of the conditions of private exchange, and, on the other hand, it causes them to continue to produce on the basis of private exchange. Although Gray merely wants &ldquo;to reform&rdquo; the money evolved by commodity exchange, he is compelled by the intrinsic logic of the subject-matter to repudiate one condition of bourgeois production after another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Big issue with the accurate price calc: it needs all the data. And how&rsquo;s it collectin&rsquo; data? Thru Exchange. All exchanges gotta go thru it. How? Lotta options. Be National&ndash; have force behind it. Be huge, meaning it&rsquo;s the most convenient. It&rsquo;s gotta be the only who who can mint Labor-Money, so faster knockoffs or alt-coins can&rsquo;t crop up. Gotta be world wide, so it really is taking into account general human labor, not just human labor born in one place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See, this guy Gray thought that commodities could be exchanged with eachother measured by their social labor. But in the System, labor gets to be social labor as solos do independent jobs, which get proved to be social labor if what they make gets exchanged. Gray thinks there&rsquo;s no check there: that all labor is automatically social labor. This would work if everybody shared the jobs of makin&rsquo; commodities, or if solos did labor without proxies or middlemen tellin&rsquo; them to. If that was true, no commodity could get turned into somethin&rsquo; everybody wants (like gold), since all commodities made would be already be somethin&rsquo; everybody else wants, since the product was only made cuz others needed it. Exchange-value couldn&rsquo;t become price without that king commodity anybody can automatically trade for. Ya couldn&rsquo;t have use-value bein&rsquo; able to be transmoffed into exchange value, and products of labor couldn&rsquo;t become commodities. And then, no System. But that ain&rsquo;t what Gray is talkin&rsquo; about. He&rsquo;s talking about a Bank which buys everything, a superstore, who everybody buys from. </p><p>That&rsquo;s the logic of the bourgeoise: Buy everything, sell everything. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is just the System: with a corpo-fascist twist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus he turns capital into national capital, and land into national property and if his bank is examined carefully it will be seen that it not only receives commodities with one hand and issues certificates for labour supplied with the other, but that it directs production itself. In his last work, Lectures on Money, in which Gray seeks timidly to present his labour money as a purely bourgeois reform, he gets tangled up in even more flagrant absurdities.</p><p>Every commodity is immediately money; this is Gray&rsquo;s thesis which he derives from his incomplete and hence incorrect analysis of commodities. The &ldquo;organic&rdquo; project of &ldquo;labour money&rdquo; and &ldquo;national bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;warehouses&rdquo; is merely a fantasy in which a dogma is made to appear as a law of universal validity. The dogma that a commodity is immediately money or that the particular labour of a private individual contained in it is immediately social labour, does not of course become true because a bank believes in it and conducts its operations in accordance with this dogma. On the contrary, bankruptcy would in such a case fulfil the function of practical criticism. The fact that labour money is a pseudo-economic term, which denotes the pious wish to get rid of money, and together with money to get rid of exchange-value, and with exchange-value to get rid of commodities, and with commodities to get rid of the bourgeois mode of production, &ndash; this fact, which remains concealed in Gray&rsquo;s work and of which Gray himself was not aware, has been bluntly expressed by several British socialists, some of whom wrote earlier than Gray and others later. But it was left to M. Proudhon and his school to declare seriously that the degradation of money and the exaltation of commodities was the essence of socialism and thereby to reduce socialism to an elementary misunderstanding of the inevitable correlation existing between commodities and money.</p><p>At this point I will only say further that Owen&rsquo;s &lsquo;labor money&rsquo;, for instance, is no more &lsquo;money&rsquo; than a theater ticket is. Owen presup-poses directly socialized labor, a form of produc-tion diametrically opposite to the production of commodities. The certiﬁcate of labor is merely evidence of the part taken by the individual in the common labor, and documents his claim to a portion of the common product that has been set aside for consumption. But Owen never makes the mistake of presupposing the production of commodities and hoping that he can, by tinker-ing with money, avoid the necessary conditions for that form of production.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, capital becomes the Superstore&rsquo;s capital, land becomes the Superstores&rsquo; land. The production process is totally controlled by the Superstore&ndash; everything is made for *it*, so it decides what it wants. What it&rsquo;ll buy. Or: what&rsquo;ll get made. Whoever controls the Superstore also controls this new, more tightly wound System. And who&rsquo;s that? </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everybody else does solo labor, but everything they make is for the Superstore: the third peculiarity all over again. All concrete labor still becomes derezzed, use-values become exchange-value. All the weird shit the System had stays: it&rsquo;s dogma, pure dogma, freaked out to get rid of it. The Superstore is just a corpo by another name, the last hope of these reformist assholes, hopin&rsquo; to get rid of the System by gettin&rsquo; rid of money. But &ldquo;Labor Money&rdquo; is basically everything Money wanted to be in the OG System: the direct measure of labor-time. The Program is *actually* givin&rsquo; Money the form it always wanted to be in.</p><p>Even with one big Player&ndash; System can go on just like it was: just better optimized. As it turns out, Proudhon ripped gray off for mutualism. What a hack, hahaha.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Robby Owens&rsquo; alternative&rsquo;s got no commodities at all. Owens labor-money ain&rsquo;t a commodity. Instead, it&rsquo;s a certificate. If ya put work in, add more wealth into society, you get a portion of what got set aside when you started the work. Labor-money ain&rsquo;t limiting&rsquo; you to a certain amount of value you individually created: It&rsquo;s givin&rsquo; you complete access to the use-values everybody socially made, planned out. Now, ya work on somethin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s actually gonna get used towards somethin&rsquo;, rather than somethin&rsquo; that has to get approved and might not sell. No incentive to trade shit ya don&rsquo;t want, or hoard it. The things you make are things people want, and the things ya get access to are things you want. Everybody produces as a group, a Big Steve, to call back to mincer. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'},

{text:'<p><a href="#c3-53" class="black"><b>53.</b></a> &lsquo;Wherever silver and gold exist side by side as legal money, i.e. as measure of value, the vain attempt has invariably been made to treat them as one and the same substance. If one assumes that a given labor-time must be objectiﬁed in the same unchanging proportion in silver and gold, then one assumes, in fact, that gold and silver are the same substance, and that silver, the less valuable metal, represents a constant fraction of gold. From the reign of Edward III to the time of George II, the history of money in England con-sists of one long series of perturbations caused by the clash between the legally ﬁxed ratio be-tween the values of gold and silver, and the ﬂuc-tuations in their real values. At one time gold was too high, at another, silver. The metal that was estimated below its value was withdrawn from circulation, melted down and exported. The ra-tio between the two metals was then again al-tered by law, but the new nominal ratio soon came into conﬂict, in its turn, with the real ra-tio. In our own times, the slight and transient fall in the value of gold compared with silver, which was a consequence of the Indian and Chi-nese demand for silver, produced on a far more extended scale in France the same phenomena, export of silver, and its expulsion from circula-tion by gold. During the years 1855, 1856 and 1857, the excess in France of gold-imports over gold-exports amounted to £41,580,000, while the excess of silver-exports over silver-imports came to £34,704,000. In fact, in countries in which both metals are legally measures of value, and therefore both legal tender, so that everyone has the option of paying in either metal, the metal that rises in value is at a premium, and, like every other commodity, measures its price in the over-valued metal which alone serves in reality as the measure of value. All the experience of history in this area can be reduced simply to this fact, that where two commodities perform by law the functions of a measure of value, in practice only one maintains that position&rsquo; (Karl Marx, op. cit., pp. 52-3) [English edition, pp. 75-6].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',altText:'<p id="f3-53">Marx starts talkin&rsquo; about the way Silver and Gold work together as one unit.

Every little shift in Productive Power the System ruined the meta: gold got too valuable, silver got too glutted&ndash; the game was unpredictable every fraggin&rsquo; patch. Players had to keep switchin&rsquo; between usin&rsquo; Gold and Silver, tried to always play as the one who was more valuable than their past selves, and melt down the other one. Eventually, players realized this was a con, and decided to set a fixed ratio: there&rsquo;d be a custom ratio to how much silver or gold could be worth in eachother. Thing is, the weird update patches kept happening: because the custom ratio wasn&rsquo;t matching with the flux ratio of value of Silver to Gold.

{text:'<p><a href="#c3-80" class="black"><b>80.</b></a> That each single kind of commodity, through its price, forms an element in the sum of the prices of all the commodities in circulation, is self-evident. But how mutually incommensu-rable use-values are to be exchanged, en masse, for the total sum of gold or silver in a country is quite incomprehensible. If we can perform the swindle of converting the world of commodities into one single total commodity, of which each commodity is merely an aliquot part, we arrive at this beautiful calculation: the total commodity = x cwt of gold; commodity A = an aliquot part of the total commodity = the same aliquot part of x cwt of gold. This is stated in all seriousness by Montesquieu: &lsquo;If one compares the amount of gold and silver in the world with the sum of the commodities available, it is certain that each product or commodity, taken in isolation, could be compared with a certain portion of the total amount of money. Let us suppose that there is only one product, or commodity, in the world, or only one that can be purchased, and that it can be divided in the same way as money: a certain part of this commodity would then correspond to a part of the total amount of money; half the total of the one would correspond to half the total of the other, etc. . . the determination of the prices of things always depends, fundamentally, on the re-lation between the total amount of things and the total amount of their monetary symbols&rsquo; (Mon-tesquieu, op. cit., Vol. 3, pp. 12, 13).

Mill in the do-main of political economy, which are neither ex-tensive nor profound, will all be found drawn up in neat and disciplined columns in his little pamphlet Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy, which appeared in 1844.  Locke expressly asserts that there is a connection between the absence of value in gold and silver, and the determination of their value by their quantity. &lsquo;Mankind having consented to put an imaginary value upon gold and silver . . . the intrinsick value, regarded in these metals, is nothing but the quantity&rsquo; (Some Considerations, etc., 1691, in Works, ed. 1777, Vol. 2, p. 15).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',altText:'<p id="f3-80">So the sum of all commodities is a way to matrix up every commodity into one Datafile.

You can take half the DataFile, or a quarter. Half the DataFile is half the total supply of money. A quarter of the DataFile is a quarter of the total supply of money. That&rsquo;s very different from saying the total amount of money changes the price of the total amount of things.

Upon the arrival of quantities from Spain . . . it is carried into the Tower, and coined. Not long after there will come a demand for bullion to be exported again. If there is none, but all happens to be in coin, what then? Melt it down again; there&rsquo;s no loss in it, for the coining costs the owner nothing. Thus the nation has been abused, and made to pay for the twisting of straw for asses to eat. If the merchant&rsquo; (North was him-self one of the biggest merchants at the time of Charles II) &lsquo;were made to pay the price of the coinage, he would not have sent his silver to the Tower without consideration; and coined money would always keep a value above uncoined sil-ver&rsquo; [Nor91, p. 18].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',altText:'<p id="f3-81">What coining does is convert and reconvert these drifter army types from one nation to another.

They pay themselves with what should&rsquo;ve been the people&rsquo;s brainwashed coin army cuz if they didn&rsquo;t, the seller of the international gold army would have to pay the fee. After all, even the state&rsquo;s gotta get paid for their work minting, neh? If the gold seller had to pay the fee, the gold seller&rsquo;d lose money on sales, be getting taken advantage of, and be less likely to sell. This is why Muller says the state &ldquo;coins for nothing.&rdquo; To the gold seller, it sure as hell looks like that.

Means of Payment</p><p>In the direct form of commod-ity circulation hitherto considered, a given value was always present twice: as a com-modity at one pole, and money at the oppo-site pole. The owners of commodities there-fore came into contact only as the repre-sentatives of simultaneously present equivalents.</p><p>But with the development of circulation, conditions arise under which the alienation of the commodity becomes separated in time from the realization of its price. It will be sufﬁcient to indicate the simplest of these conditions. One sort of commodity requires a longer, another a shorter time for its production. The production of different commodities depends on different seasons of the year. One commodity may be born in the market place, another must travel to a distant market. One commodity owner may therefore step forth as a seller before the other is ready to buy.</p><p>When the same transactions are continually repeated between the same persons, the con-ditions of sale are regulated according to the conditions of production.</p><p>On the other hand, the use of certain kinds of commodity (houses, for instance) is sold for a deﬁnite period. Only after the lease has expired has the buyer actually received the use-value of the commodity. He therefore buys it before he pays for it.</p><p id="c3-96">The seller sells an existing commodity, the buyer buys as the mere representative of money, or rather as the representative of fu-ture money. The seller becomes a creditor, the buyer becomes a debtor. Since the meta-morphosis of commodities, or the develop-ment of their form of value, has undergone a change here, money receives a new function as well. It becomes means of payment.<sub><a href="#f3-96" class="black inline"><b>96</b></a></sub></p><p id="c3-97">The role of creditor or of debtor results here from the simple circulation of commodities. The change in its form im-presses this new stamp on seller and buyer. At ﬁrst, therefore, these new roles are just as transient as those of seller and buyer, and are played alternately by the same actors. Nevertheless, this opposition now looks less pleasant from the very outset, and it is capa-ble of a more rigid crystallization.<sub><a href="#f3-97" class="black inline"><b>97</b></a></sub></p><p>However, the same characteristics can emerge independently of the circulation of com-modities. The class struggle in the ancient world, for instance, took the form mainly of a contest between debtors and creditors, and ended in Rome with the ruin of the plebeian debtors, who were replaced by slaves. In the Middle Ages the contest ended with the ruin of the feudal debtors, who lost their po-litical power together with its economic ba-sis. Here, indeed, the money-form—and the relation between creditor and debtor does have the form of a money-relation—was only the reﬂection of an antagonism which lay deeper, at the level of the economic con-ditions of existence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',altText:'<p>With the System, parts and features get modified by players- no single admin is in control.

But now, a commodity can be ready to be sent to a Buyer, while the cash to pay for it isn&rsquo;t freed up yet. Maybe the Buyer hasn&rsquo;t gotten to sell their commodity, which takes a long time to produce, or it only comes out in springtime, or they&rsquo;re far away from somebody who wants it. Getting cash and commodity to the Backrooms at the same time starts getting tricky.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe we&rsquo;ve made a couple of deals, and I trust you. With that trust, how developed your production is becomes all that matters.

{text:'<p><a href="#c3-108" class="black"><b>108.</b></a> Hence the absurdity of all legislation lay-ing down that the banks of a country should form reserves only of the particular precious metal cir-culating within the country as money. The &lsquo;pleas-ant difﬁculties&rsquo; created in this way by the Bank of England for itself are a well-known example. On the subject of the major historical epochs in the relative value of gold and silver, see Karl Marx, op. cit., pp. 136 ff. [English edition, pp. 155 ff.]. Sir Robert Peel, by his Bank Act of 1844, sought to tide over the difﬁculty by allow-ing the Bank of England to issue notes against sil-ver bullion, on condition that the reserve of silver should never exceed more than one fourth of the reserve of gold. For that purpose, the value of silver is estimated according to its market price (in gold) on the London market. [The following was added by Engels to the fourth German edi-tion:] We ﬁnd ourselves once more in a period of strong changes in the relative values of gold and silver. About twenty-ﬁve years ago the ra-tio expressing the relative value of gold and sil-ver was 15 1/2:1; now it is approximately 22:1, and silver is still constantly falling as against gold. This is essentially the result of a revo-lution in the mode of production of both met-als. Formerly gold was obtained almost exclu-sively by washing it out from gold-bearing allu-vial deposits, products of the weathering of aurif-erous rocks. Now this method has become inad-equate and has been forced into the background by the processing of quartz lodes themselves, a mode of extraction which formerly was only of secondary importance, although well known to the ancients (Diodorus, III, 12&ndash;14). Moreover, not only were huge new silver deposits discov-ered in North America in the western part of the Rocky Mountains, but these and the Mexican silver mines were really opened up by the laying of railways, which made possible the shipment of modern machinery and fuel and in consequence the mining of silver on a very large scale at low cost. However, there is a great difference in the way the two metals occur in the quartz lodes. The gold is mostly native, but disseminated through-out the quartz in minute quantities. The whole mass of the vein must therefore be crushed and the gold either washed out or extracted by means of mercury. Often 1,000,000 grammes of quartz barely yield 1&ndash;3 grammes of gold, and very sel-dom do they yield 30&ndash;60 grammes. Silver is sel-dom found native: however, it occurs in special quartz that is separated from the lode with com-parative ease and contains mostly 40&ndash;90 per cent silver, and is also contained, in smaller quanti-ties, in copper, lead and other ores which in them-selves are worthwhile working. From this alone it is apparent that the labor expended on the pro-duction of gold is tending to increase, while that expended on silver production has decidedly de-creased, which quite naturally explains the drop in the value of the latter. This fall in value would express itself in a still greater fall in price if the price of silver were not pegged even today by artiﬁcial means. But America&rsquo;s rich silver de-posits have so far barely been tapped, and thus the prospects are that the value of this metal will keep on dropping for rather a long time to come. A still greater contributing factor here is the rela-tive decrease in the need for silver for articles of general use and for luxuries, that is its replace-ment by plated goods, aluminium, etc. One may thus gauge the utopianism of the bimetallist idea that compulsory international quotation will raise silver again to the old value ratio of 1:15 1/2. It is more likely that silver will forfeit its money function more and more in the world market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',altText:'<p id="f3-108">Back in the metal psycho analog era, the Bank of England dind&rsquo;t wanna go for a stable  ratio between gold and silver.

Marxy starts us off by explaining that the giant sphere, commodity circulation, is its Homeplanet: TradeWorld. First thing we know: whatever Capital is, it left TradeWorld, and was determined to conquer the rest of the galaxy. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We also know that at some point during the 16th century, just as TradeWorld (World Trade), got big enough, Capital went fully modernized in how it killed, fucked, and birthed. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TradeWorld is made up of commodities, orphans forced thru the Backrooms to find owners who will treat them as SexKittens. Since Capital emerged from the TradeWorld, it&rsquo;s gotta be created by the TradeWorld. And we know, that in the end, the thing that the TradeWorld generates is Money: this is the force it needs to push the commodities thru its Backrooms. Since Capital emerges from TradeWorld, it means that somehow,  Capital must be related to Money, right? </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well there&rsquo;s something Money needs to unite with first. Some forbidden Commodity that they&rsquo;ll fuck in a bloodstained BackRoom, which&rsquo;ll spawn the Galaxy Conqueror. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We learn that Massive Hoard Owners: like the Rich, the Merchants, and the Debt Lenders, had some kinda chess game with the Lords, the ones who ruled by force and owned land. The Money they had was Capital, used a Warrior to fight for TradeWorld against brutal assholes who were gonna steal all the SexKittens, rather than pay for &lsquo;em.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves. We don&rsquo;t gotta uncover Capital&rsquo;s super-secret origin, like it&rsquo;s some kinda superhero. Capital tells us its life story every fuckin&rsquo; day, a round-the-clock cyber-soap on TV.

Instead, Money&rsquo;s gonna force that Commodity to go to another Owner who hates it. Then the Owner sells it to get a different Squad back.</p><p>The kinda Money that doesn&rsquo;t fuck the Orphan?

{text:'<p id="c4-2">Let us examine the circular move-ment M −C −M a little more closely. Like the simple circulation of commodities, it passes through two opposite phases. In the ﬁrst phase, M−C (the purchase), the money is changed into a commodity. In the second phase, C − M (the sale), the commodity is changed back into money. The unity of these two phases, however, is the movement as a whole, which exchanges money for a commodity and the same com-modity back for money, which buys a com-modity in order to sell it, or, if one neglects the formal differences between buying and selling, buys a commodity with money and then buys money with a commodity.<sub><a href="#f4-2" class="black inline"><b>2</b></a></sub></p><p>The result which remains after completion of the process is the exchange of money for money, M −M.</p><p>If I purchase 2000 lb. cotton for £100, and resell them for £110, I have, in the end, ex-changed £100 for £110, money for money.</p><p>Now it is evident that the circula-tory process M − C − M would be absurd and devoid of content if the intention were, by using this roundabout route, to exchange two equal sums of money, £100 for £100.

{text:'<p>Let us ﬁrst see what the two forms have in common. Both circular paths are composed of the same two opposite phases, C − M, sale, and M −C, purchase. In each phase the same material elements confront each other, namely a commodity and money, and the same economic character masks, a buyer and a seller. Each circular path is the unity of the same two opposite phases, and in each case this unity is mediated through the participation of three contractual agents, of whom one only sells, another only buys, and the third both buys and sells.</p><p>However the two circular paths C− M −C and M −C −M differ, obviously, by the inverted order in which the same two opposite phases of circulation are traversed. The simple circulation of commodities be-gins with a sale and ends with a purchase, while the circulation of money as capital be-gins with a purchase and ends with a sale.</p><p>In the one case, starting point and end point of the movement are commodities, in the other, money. The whole process is medi-ated in the ﬁrst form by money, while in the second, inversely, by the commodity.</p><p>In the circulation C−M−C, money is in the end converted into a commodity which serves as a use-value; it has therefore been spent once and for all. In the inverted form M −C −M, on the contrary, the buyer lays out money in order that, as a seller, he may recover money. By his purchase of a commodity he throws money into circu-lation, in order to withdraw it again by the sale of the same commodity. He releases the money, but only with the cunning intention of getting it back again.</p><p id="c4-3">The money therefore is not spent, it is merely advanced.<sub><a href="#f4-3" class="black inline"><b>3</b></a></sub></p><p>In the form C − M −C, the same piece of money is displaced twice. The seller gets it from the buyer and pays it away to another seller. The whole process, which begins with the receipt of money in return for commodities, comes to an end with the relinquishing of money in return for com-modities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',
altText:'<p>Both C-M-C and M-C-M have purchases in &lsquo;em: one&rsquo;s got it in the front and one&rsquo;s got it in the back.

With M-C-M you start with money. And their both got middlemen: with C-M-C, it&rsquo;s money, and with M-C-M, it&rsquo;s money.

{text:'<p>In the form M −C − M this process is in-verted. Here it is not the piece of money which is displaced twice, but the commod-ity. The buyer takes it from the hands of the seller and passes it into the hands of an-other buyer. Whilst in the simple circula-tion of commodities the twofold displacement of the same piece of money effects its deﬁnitive transfer from one hand into an-other, here the twofold displacement of the same commodity causes the money to ﬂow back to its initial point of departure.</p><p>This reﬂux of money to its starting-point does not depend on the commodity&rsquo;s being sold for more than was paid for it. That only has a bearing on the amount of money which ﬂows back. The phenomenon of reﬂux itself takes place as soon as the pur-chased commodity is resold, i.e., as soon as the cycle M −C − M has been traversed in its entirety. This is, therefore, a palpable dif-ference between the circulation of money as capital, and its circulation as mere money.</p><p>The cycle C − M −C is fully tra-versed when the money brought in by the sale of one commodity is withdrawn again by the purchase of another. If nevertheless a reﬂux of money to its starting-point occurs, this can happen only through a renewal or repetition of the whole course of the move-ment. If I sell a quarter of corn for £3, and with this £3 buy clothes, the money, so far as I am concerned, is irreversibly spent. I have nothing more to do with it. It belongs to the clothes merchant. If I now sell a second quarter of corn, money indeed ﬂows back to me—not however as a result of the ﬁrst transaction, but due to its repetition. The money again leaves me as soon as I complete this second transaction by a fresh pur-chase. In the cycle C − M −C, therefore, there is no connection between the expendi-ture of money and its reﬂux.</p><p>In M −C − M, on the other hand, the very manner in which the money is expended re-lies on its reﬂux. Without this reﬂux, the operation fails, or the process is interrupted and incomplete, since its complementary ﬁ-nal phase, the sale, is missing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

The movement in the course of which it adds surplus-value is its own movement, its val-orization is therefore self-valorization. It has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself, by virtue of being value. It brings forth living offspring, or at least lays golden eggs.</p><p>As the overarching subject of such a process, in which it alternately as-sumes and discards the forms of money and commodities, but preserves and expands itself through all these changes, value is above all in need of an independent form by means of which its identity with itself is asserted. Only in the shape of money does it possess this form. Money is therefore the starting point and the conclusion of every valorization process.

By contrast, in the circulation M−C−M, value suddenly presents itself as a self-moving substance, which passes through a process of its own, and for which commodities and money are both mere forms. Even more: in-stead of simply representing the relations of commodities, value now enters into a private relationship with itself, as it were.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

Then, how-ever, MacCulloch comes on the scene, and as-serts that to buy in order to sell is to speculate, and thus the distinction between speculation and trade vanishes. &lsquo;Every transaction in which an individual buys produce in order to sell it again is in fact a speculation&rsquo; (MacCulloch, A Dictionary, Practical etc., of Commerce, London, 1847, p. 1009).

So far as it is the art of acquisition, it is limited to procur-ing the articles necessary to existence and use-ful either to a household or the state. &lsquo;True wealth (å ‡ljdinäc ploÜtoc) consists of such use-values; for the amount of property which is needed for a good life is not unlimited . . . There is, however, a second mode of acquiring things, to which we may by preference and with cor-rectness give the name of chrematistics, and in this case there appear to be no limits to riches and property. Trade (&ldquo;š kaphlikŸ&rdquo; is literally retail trade, and Aristotle chooses this form be-cause use-values predominate in it) does not in its nature belong to chrematistics, for here the exchange only has reference to what is necessary for (the buyer or the seller) themselves.&rsquo; There-fore, as he goes on to show, the original form of trade was barter, but with the extension of the latter there arose the necessity for money. With the discovery of money, barter of necessity de-veloped into kaphlikŸ, into trading in commodi-ties, and this again, in contradiction with its orig-inal tendency, grew into chrematistics, the art of making money. Now chrematistics can be distin-guished from economics in that &lsquo;for chrematis-tics, circulation is the source of riches (poihtikŸ qrhm‹twn . . . di• qrhm‹twn metabol¬c). And it appears to revolve around money, for money is the beginning and the end of this kind of ex-change (tä g•r nìmisma stoiqeØon kaÈ pèrac t¬c ‡llag¬c èstÐn). Therefore also riches, such as chrematistics strives for, are unlimited. Just as every art which is not a means to an end, but an end in itself, has no limit to its aims, because it seeks constantly to approach nearer and nearer to that end, while those arts which pursue means to an end are not boundless, since the goal itself imposes a limit on them, so with chrematistics there are no bounds to its aims, these aims being absolute wealth. Economics, unlike chrematis-tics, has a limit . . . for the object of the former is something different from money, of the latter the augmentation of money . . . By confusing these two forms, which overlap each other, some peo-ple have been led to look upon the preservation and increase of money ad inﬁnitum as the ﬁnal goal of economics.&rsquo; (Aristotle, De Republica, edit.
