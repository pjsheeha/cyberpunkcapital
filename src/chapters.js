  {text:`<p>London, 18 March 1872<br />To citizen Maurice La Chatre <br />Dear Citizen,<br /><br />I applaud your idea of publishing the translation of Capital as a serial. In this form the book will be more accessible to the working class, a consideration which to me outweighs everything else.<br />That is the good side of your suggestion, but here is the reverse of the medal: the method of analysis which I have employed, and which had not previously been applied to economic subjects, makes the reading of the ﬁrst chapters rather arduous, and it is to be feared that the French public, always impatient to come to a conclusion, eager to know the connection between general principles and the immediate questions that have aroused their passions, may be disheartened because they will be unable to move on at once. That is a disadvantage I am powerless to overcome, unless it be by forewarning and forearming those readers who zealously seek the truth. There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits. Believe me, dear citizen, <br /><br />Your devoted,<br />Karl Marx</p>`,altText: '<p>Alright, so this load of corpo talk from the old Paranoid, Karl Marx, is pretty boilerplate. But &lsquo;member, that long version over on the left, that stuff is legally boring. I&rsquo;m here to make it real easy to understand. He&rsquo;s fixin&rsquo; with his choomba in France and givin&rsquo; him a big thanks for helpin&rsquo; him out with the French Edition of his dirtyscrip, &lsquo;Das Kapital.&rsquo; But Marxy is a bit worried about the French proles not getting it, cuz the first few chapters are so tough to get through. He feels rotten about it, but in the end figures you gotta work to get offworld, right?</p>'}

    {text:'<p>This work, whose ﬁrst volume I now submit to the public, forms the continuation of my book Zur Kritik der Politischen Oekonomie, published in 1859. The long pause between the ﬁrst part and the continuation is due to an illness of many years&rsquo; duration, which interrupted my work again and again.</p><br /><p >The substance of that earlier work is summarized in the ﬁrst chapter of this volume. This is done not merely for the sake of connectedness and completeness. The presentation is improved. As far as circumstances in any way permit, many points only hinted at in the earlier book are here worked out more fully, while, conversely, points worked out fully there are only touched upon in this volume. The sections on the history of the theories of value and of money are now, of course, left out altogether. However, the reader of the earlier work will ﬁnd new sources relating to the history of those theories in the notes to the ﬁrst chapter. Beginnings are always difﬁcult in all sciences. The understanding of the ﬁrst chapter, especially the section that contains the analysis of commodities, will therefore present the greatest difﬁculty.<p  id="c0-1"> I have popularized the passages concerning the substance of value and the magnitude of value as much as possible. <sub><a href= "#f0-1"  class="black inline">1</sub></p>',

Nevertheless, the human mind has sought in vain for more than 2,000 years to get to the bottom of it, while on the other hand there has been at least an approximation to a successful analysis of forms which are much richer in content and more complex. Why? Because the complete body is easier to study than its cells.</p><p>Moreover, in the analysis of economic forms neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of assistance. The power of abstraction must replace both. But for bourgeois society, the commodity-form of the product of labor, or the value-form of the commodity, is the economic cell-form. To the uneducated observer, the analysis of these forms seems to turn upon minutiae. It does in fact deal with minutiae, but so similarly does microscopic anatomy. With the exception of the section on the form of value, therefore, this volume cannot stand accused on the score of difﬁ-culty.

      text:'<p>The physicist observes natural processes either in situations where they appear in the clearest form with the least contamination by disturbing inﬂuences, or, wherever possible, he makes experiments under conditions which ensure that the process will occur in its pure state. What I have to examine in this work is the capitalist mode of production, and the relations of production and forms of intercourse that correspond to it. Until now, their locus classicus has been England. This is the reason why England is used as the main illustration of the theoretical developments I make. If, however, the German reader pharisaically shrugs his shoulders at the condition of the English industrial and agricultural workers, or optimistically comforts himself with the thought that in Germany things are not nearly so bad, I must plainly tell him: De te fabula narratur!</p> <p>Intrinsically, it is not a question of the higher or lower degree of development of the social antagonisms that spring from the natural laws of capitalist production. It is a question of these laws themselves, of these tendencies winning their way through and working themselves out with iron necessity. The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future.</p>',

In all other spheres, and just like the rest of Continental Western Europe, we suffer not only from the development of capitalist production, but also from the incompleteness of that development. Alongside the modern evils, we are oppressed by a whole series of inherited evils, arising from the passive survival of archaic and outmoded modes of production, with their accompanying train of anachronistic social and political relations. We suffer not only from the living, but from the dead. Le mort saisit le vif!</p><p>The social statistics of Germany and the rest of Continental Western Europe are, in comparison with those of England, quite wretched.

Perseus wore a magic cap so that the monsters he hunted down might not see him. We draw the magic cap down over our own eyes and ears so as to deny that there are any monsters.</p><p>Let us not deceive ourselves about this. Just as in the eighteenth century the American War of Independence sounded the tocsin for the European middle class, so in the nineteenth century the American Civil War did the same for the European working class. In England the process of transformation is palpably evident. When it has reached a certain point, it must react on the Continent. There it will take a form more brutal or more humane, according to the degree of development of the working class itself.</p>',

For this reason, among others, I have devoted a great deal of space in this volume to the history, the details, and the results of the English factory legislation.</p><p>One nation can and should learn from others. Even when a society has begun to track down the natural laws of its movement&mdash;and it is the ultimate aim of this work to reveal the economic law of motion of modern society&mdash;it can neither leap over the natural phases of its development nor remove them by decree. But it can shorten and lessen the birth-pangs. To prevent possible misunderstandings, let me say this. I do not by any means depict the capitalist and the landowner in rosy colours. But individuals are dealt with here only in so far as they are the personiﬁcations of economic categories, the bearers of particular class-relations and interests. My standpoint, which views the development of the economic formation of society as a process of natural history, can less than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature he remains socially, however much he may subjectively raise himself above them.</p>',

The peculiar nature of the material it deals with summons into the fray on the opposing side the most violent, sordid and malignant passions of the human breast, the Furies of private interest. The Established Church, for instance, will more readily pardon an attack on thirty-eight of its thirty-nine articles than on one thirty-ninth of its income. Nowadays atheism itself is a culpa levis, as compared with the criticism of existing property relations. Nevertheless, even here there is an unmistakable advance. I refer, as an example, to the Blue Book published within the last few weeks: &lsquo;Correspondence with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Missions Abroad, Regarding lndustrial Questions and Trades&rsquo; Unions&rsquo;. There the representatives of the English Crown in foreign countries declare in plain language that in Germany, in France, in short in all the civilized states of the European Continent, a radical change in the existing relations between capital and labor is as evident and inevitable as in Eng]and. At the same time, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Mr. Wade, Vice-President of the United States, has declared in public meetings that, after the abolition of slavery, a radical transformation in the existing relations of capital and landed property is on the agenda.</p>',
