Karl Marx created Capital Volume 1 to explain commodities, the value-form, and capitalist production. We have it, here, together, as simply as we could organize it, with some informal short summaries to help you understand what it means. The short summaries on the right have been handled by Johnny Silverhand, a Rockerboy, a real cyberpunk who knows what’s what when it comes to translating disgust-at-capitalism. But, just so you know, it’s the full text on the left that’s important/well thought out.

That is a disadvantage I am powerless to overcome, unless it be by forewarning and forearming those readers who zealously seek the truth.

At the same time, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Mr. Wade, Vice-President of the United States, has declared in public meetings that, after the abolition of slavery, a radical transformation in the existing relations of capital and landed property is on the agenda.</p>',\n      altText:'<p>Corpos hate when people scientifically analyze their precious system.
