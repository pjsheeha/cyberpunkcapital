That is a disadvantage I am powerless to overcome, unless it be by forewarning and forearming those readers who zealously seek the truth.

But it can shorten and lessen the birth-pangs. To prevent possible misunderstandings, let me say this. I do not by any means depict the capitalist and the landowner in rosy colours. But individuals are dealt with here only in so far as they are the personiÔ¨Åcations of economic categories, the bearers of particular class-relations and interests. My standpoint, which views the development of the economic formation of society as a process of natural history, can less than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature he remains socially, however much he may subjectively raise himself above them.</p>',\n      altText:'<p>Marx believes in open source.

The Established Church, for instance, will more readily pardon an attack on thirty-eight of its thirty-nine articles than on one thirty-ninth of its income. Nowadays atheism itself is a culpa levis, as compared with the criticism of existing property relations. Nevertheless, even here there is an unmistakable advance. I refer, as an example, to the Blue Book published within the last few weeks: &lsquo;Correspondence with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Missions Abroad, Regarding lndustrial Questions and Trades&rsquo; Unions&rsquo;. There the representatives of the English Crown in foreign countries declare in plain language that in Germany, in France, in short in all the civilized states of the European Continent, a radical change in the existing relations between capital and labor is as evident and inevitable as in Eng]and.

Karl Marx created Capital Volume 1 to explain commodities, the value-form, and capitalist production. We have it, here, together, as simply as we could organize it, with some informal short summaries to help you understand what it means. The short summaries on the right have been handled by Johnny Silverhand, a Rockerboy, a real cyberpunk who knows what‚Äôs what when it comes to translating disgust-at-capitalism. But, just so you know, it‚Äôs the full text on the left that‚Äôs important/well thought out. This version of Capital Volume 1 was translated by Hans Ehrbar. <sub>Note: This is not corpo approved and we are not endorsed or affiliated with CDProjektRed.</sub>  </p>\n      <h2 id=\"top\" className=\"center\">{(chapters[elem][0].title).toUpperCase()}</h2>\n      <h2  className=\"faded-yellow center no-space\">‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï</h2>\n      <br></br>\n      <div class=\"ua__item\"><div class=\"ua__item-content\"><div class=\"ua__item-content-left\"><h6 class=\"ua__item-column-title\">FULL TEXT</h6></div><div class=\"ua__item-content-right\"><h6 class=\"ua__item-column-title\">QUICK SUMMARY</h6></div></div></div>\n      <div class=\"ua__item-title\"></div>\n      {chapterSection()}\n      </div>\n\n    </section>\n    <footer className=\"l-footer__platforms\">\n      <div className = \"l-content\">\n        <div>\n          <ul className=\"l-footer__top-nav wide__platforms\">\n            <li className=\"l-footer__top-nav-cond\"><h1 className=\"yellow\">Select a Chapter</h1></li>\n            <li></li>\n\n  \n\n          <li className=\"l-footer__top-nav-cond\">\n            {chapters[elem-1] ?(  <a className = \"save-button\" href=\"#top\" onClick={()=>{notifSave(0);chapterChanger(elem-1)}} >‚Üê Previous Chapter </a>):(<span className=\"faded-yellow\">...</span>)}\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"l-footer__top-nav-cond\">\n            {chapters[elem+1]?(  <a className = \"save-button\" href=\"#top\" onClick={()=>{notifSave(0);chapterChanger(elem+1)}} >Next Chapter ‚Üí</a>):(<span className=\"faded-yellow\">More coming soon!</span>)}\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <ul className=\"l-footer__logos\" id =\"chapters\">\n          \n          {chapters.map((chap,index)=><li><a href=\"#top\"className =\"l-footer_button-present\"onClick={()=>{notifSave(0);chapterChanger(index)}}><h2 className={ elem === index?'faded-yellow':'yellow'}>{Capitalize(chap[0].title)}</h2></a></li>)}\n          </ul>\n          <ul className=\"l-footer__links\">\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://paypal.me/pools/c/8vbGkmm37Q\">send a tip!</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://perebite.com/\">my other stuff</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cyberpunk.capital/\">insta</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://twitter.com/cyberpunkapital/\">twitter</a></li>\n\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/index.htm\">marxists.org</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://content.csbs.utah.edu/~ehrbar/akmc.htm\">hans ehrbar translation</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"mailto:peter@perebite.com\">email me</a></li>\n\n\n\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </footer>\n    \n    </div>\n    </>\n    <div>\n    <ReactTooltip />\n\n    <ToastContainer closeOnClick={false} onClick={(e) => {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      window.location.href='#'+chapters[elem][subelem].name;\n      }} />\n\n      </div>\n    </ThemeProvider>\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nexport const useDarkMode = () => {\n    const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n    const [mountedComponent, setMountedComponent] = useState(false)\n\n    const setMode = mode => {\n        window.localStorage.setItem('theme', mode)\n        setTheme(mode)\n    };\n\n    const themeToggler = () => {\n        theme === 'light' ? setMode('dark') : setMode('light')\n    };\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        const localTheme = window.localStorage.getItem('theme');\n        localTheme && setTheme(localTheme)\n        setMountedComponent(true)\n\n    }, []);\n    return [theme, themeToggler,mountedComponent]\n};","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
