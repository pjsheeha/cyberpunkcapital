This self-opposed movement arises out of the two-edged character of labor. Productiv-ity, of course, is always the productivity of concrete, useful labor; it determines how ef-fective a purposeful productive activity can be in a given period of time. Useful labor becomes, therefore, a more or less abundant source of products in direct proportion as its productivity rises or falls. As against this, however, variations in productivity in them-selves have zero impact on the labor repre-sented in value. As productivity is an at-tribute of labor in its concrete useful form, it naturally ceases to have any bearing on that labor as soon as we abstract from its con-crete useful form. The same labor, therefore, performed for the same length of time, always yields the same amount of value, in-dependently of any variations in its produc-tivity.

The coat would be the relative and the equivalent at the same time&ndash; and that ain&rsquo;t an exchange, it&rsquo;s a con. But since all commodities got value, value can apply in any situation. Value gets replaced for value everyday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That confused some econo-posers, who thought value was just a quantity to be measured. But value is also a social concept: that human labor is equal in all humans. It&rsquo;ll always be the initial fuel source. This is the substance of value&ndash; humans, no matter how much they push the limit, use human labor to make useful shit.</p>'},\n    {text:'<p>Rather, the equivalent form of a commodity does not contain any quantitative determination of value at all.</p><p>The ﬁrst peculiarity which strikes us when we consider the equivalent form is this, that use-value becomes the form of ap-pearance of its opposite, value. The natural form of the commodity becomes form of value. But, note well, this reversal happens for commodity B (coat, or maize, or iron, etc.) only if some arbitrary other commodity A (linen etc.) enters into a value relation with it, and this reversal holds only within this relation. Since a commodity cannot relate to itself as equivalent, and therefore cannot make its own physical skin into the expression of its own value, it must relate to another com-modity as equivalent, and therefore must make the physical skin of another commodity into its own value form. Let us make this clear with the example of a measure which belongs to commodities as material objects, i.e. as use-values. A sugar-loaf, because it is a body, consists of heavy matter and therefore has a weight, but one can neither see this weight nor touch it. We then take various pieces of iron, whose weight has been determined beforehand. The bodily form of the iron, considered for itself, is no more the form of appearance of heavy matter than is the bodily form of the sugarloaf.</p><p>Nevertheless, in order to express the sugar-loaf as heavy matter, we place it into a weight relation with the iron. In this relation, the iron counts as a body representing nothing but heavy matter. Quantities of iron therefore serve to measure the weight of the sugar and represent, in relation to the sugar-loaf, heavy matter pure and simple, the in-carnation of heavy matter.</p>',\n    altText:'<p>The equivalent form is just use-value, and we can&rsquo;t get its value from that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An equivalent form&rsquo;s concrete quality (use-value) is forced to derezz itself to become a general, abstract quantity (value), so it can be replaced by the relative form in an exchange.

A body-bag is heavy&ndash; it&rsquo;s got weight. But we can&rsquo;t see its weight from how it looks. My bullet, I know, weighs 150 GR. Since I know the weight of a bullet, I can figure out the weight of the corpse by tossin&rsquo; bullets onto a balance scale. The bullet loses its ability to be fired&ndash; it&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; a glorified measurin&rsquo; tool. And the body-bag is sittin&rsquo; pretty as the thing we wanted to weigh. When the scale&rsquo;s level, I got the weight of the corpse in the amount of bullets I tossed on. Same with exchanges: the total bullets&rsquo; weight is the relative value, and it&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; represented by the body-bag. So, by usin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; we do know the weight of, we found the weight of somethin&rsquo; we didn&rsquo;t.</p>'},\n    {text:'<p>This part is played by the iron only within this relation, i.e. within the relation into which the sugar, or any other body whose weight is to be found, enters with the iron. If both objects lacked heavy matter, they could not enter into this relation, hence the one could not serve to express the heavy matter of the other.If we place both of them on the scales, we see in actuality that as heavy matter they are one and the same, and therefore that, taken in the appropriate proportions, they have the same weight.</p><p>Just as the bodily form of the iron, as a mea-sure of weight, represents nothing but heavy matter towards the sugar-loaf, so, in our ex-pression of value, the bodily form of the coat represents nothing but value towards the linen. Here, however, the analogy ceases. In the weight expression of the sugar-loaf, the iron represents a natural property com-mon to both bodies, their heavy matter; but in the value expression of the linen, the coat represents a supranatural property: their value, which is something purely social. The relative value form of a com-modity, of the linen for example, expresses the value-being of the linen as something quite different from its body and bodily properties, namely, for example, as some-thing which looks like a coat. This expres-sion itself indicates that it conceals a social relation. Not so with the equivalent form, in which the body of the commodity itself, here the coat, just as it is in everyday life, expresses value—as if its value form were given to it by nature.</p><p id=\"c1-21\">Admittedly, this holds good only within the value relation, in which the commodity linen is related to the commodity coat as its equivalent.<sub><a href=\"#f1-21\" class=\"black inline\"><b>21</b></a></sub> </p>',\n    altText:'<p>If the body-bag or the bullets were in zero G, ya couldn&rsquo;t use &lsquo;em to weigh each other&ndash; they wouldn&rsquo;t have weight at all.

Hence the mysteriousness of the equivalent form, which only impinges on the crude bourgeois vision of the political economist when it confronts him in its fully developed shape, that of money. He then seeks to ex-plain away the mystical character of gold and silver by substituting less dazzling com-modities for them and, with ever-renewed satisfaction, reeling off a catalogue of all the inferior commodities which have played the role of the equivalent at one time or another. He does not suspect that even the sim-plest expression of value, such as 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, already presents us with the riddle of the equivalent form. The body of the commodity, which serves as the equivalent, always counts as the embodiment of abstract human labor, while it always is the product of some spe-ciﬁc useful and concrete labor.</p><p>This concrete labor therefore becomes the expression of abstract human labor.</p><p>If the coat counts as realization of mere ab-stract human labor, the tailoring actually re-alized in it counts as the form in which mere abstract human labor realizes itself. </p>',\n    altText:'<p>Nature does shit because of physics.

I mean Aris-totle. In the ﬁrst place, Aristotle states quite clearly that the Money form of the commodity is only a further development of the Simple form of value, i.e. of the expres-sion of the value of a commodity in some other arbitrarily chosen commodity, for he says:</p><p>&ldquo;5 beds = 1 house&rdquo; (clinai pente anti oiciaς)</p><p>Does not differ from:</p><p>&ldquo;5 beds = a certain amount of money.&rdquo; (clinai pente anti … oson ai pente clinai)</p>',\n    altText:'<p>Sure, we got guys callin&rsquo; themselves tailors, doin&rsquo; concrete labor: but based on the last &ldquo;what-the-fuck,&rdquo; we know *that* becomes abstract labor.

Their form of value is simple and common to all, hence general. </p><p>The two previous forms (let us call them A and B) only got as far as expressing the value of a commodity as something distinct from its own use-value or physical body. The ﬁrst form, A, produced equations like this: 1 coat = 20 yards of linen, 10 lb. of tea = 1/2 ton of iron. The value of the coat is expressed as something which is like linen, that of the tea as something which is like iron. These expressions of the value of coat and tea are therefore as different as linen is from iron. This form, it is plain, appears in practice only in the early stages, when the products of labor are converted into commodities by accidental occasional exchanges.</p><p>The second form, B, distinguishes the value of a commodity more completely from its own use-value, for the value of the coat now contrasts its bodily form by assuming all possible shapes, that of linen, iron, tea, etc., every shape but that of a coat. On the other hand, this immediately excludes any expression of value common to all commodities; for, in the expression of value of each commodity, all other commodities only appear in the form of equivalents. The Expanded form of value comes into actual existence for the ﬁrst time when a particular product of labor, such as cattle, is no longer exceptionally, but habitually, exchanged for various other commodities.</p>',\n  altText:'<p>Form we got now&rsquo;s pretty different.   </p><p>All commodities express their values in 2 ways now: simple forms (solo) and unified forms (all commodities can be expressed in the linen). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simple form had us focusin&rsquo; on the difference between use values. Problem was value became a bit too much like comparin&rsquo; use values during exchanges. We were set on sellin&rsquo; our coat to get that sexy, useful linen. Suddenly, the value of a particular commodity became a means to get another use value: value became use-value. This ain&rsquo;t the System as we know it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ok, so we made another form, still separatin&rsquo; use value and value. One thing could represent anything&ndash; except itself. All shit became equivalent, which meant the value within &lsquo;em wasn&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; expressed (only their use-values). All that mattered was everything was equal. The Expanded form arrived when one thing becomes the only thing you usually use to buy everything else. Sort of like money.</p>'},\n  {text:'<p>The new form we have just obtained expresses the values of the world of commodities in one single kind of commodity set apart from the rest, in linen for example, and thus represents the values of all commodities through their equality with linen. The equation with linen differentiates the value of every commodity not only from its own use-value, but from all use-values. Hence the value is expressed as that which this commodity has in common with all commodities. Only this form, therefore, has the effect of relating the commodities with each other as values, or enables them to appear to each other as exchange-values. The two earlier forms express the value of a given commodity either in terms of a single commodity of a different kind, or in a series of many commodities which differ from the given commodity. In both cases it is the private task, so to speak, of the individual commodity to give itself a form of value, and it accomplishes this task without the aid of the others, which play towards it the merely passive role of equivalents.</p><p>The general form of value, on the other hand, can only arise as a joint work of the whole world of commodities. A commodity gains a general expression of its value only when, at the same time, all other commodities express their values in the same equivalent; and every newly emergent commodity must follow suit. It thus becomes evident that because the objectivity of commodities as values is the purely &lsquo;social existence&rsquo; of these things, it can only be expressed through an all-sided social relation; consequently the form of their values must be a socially valid form.</p>',\n  altText:'<p>Linen is still preem to gettin&rsquo; whatever the fuck we want. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of that, we can see real easy that all commodities are related to eachother. If anything got the same amount of value as the 20 yards, then, logically, I can also trade it to get back 20 yards. Remember this though: the linen&rsquo;s gotta be embedded in the nervewires of society. It&rsquo;s gotta be seen as the thing that makes the System go round.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How do you do that? Make a commodity that Ace? Convincin&rsquo; people&rsquo;s hard. Gotta be coordinated, cut deep into the minds of everybody. That&rsquo;s what the general form is. Every commodity works together to make sure there&rsquo;s only one equivalent. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This means the Market socially decides the forms of value: which commodity&rsquo;s the All-sided one (anything can get it, so logically it can also get anything)? Somehow, everybody&rsquo;s gotta think that one commodity is the supreme authority. How do ya think that happened? Sounds impossible, neh? And yet…</p>'},\n  {text:'<p>In this form, which sets all commodities equal to the linen, the commodities appear not only as qualitatively equal, as values in general, but also as values whose quantities can be compared. Because the magnitudes of their values are expressed in one and the same material, the linen, these magnitudes are now reﬂected in each other. For instance, 10 lbs. of tea = 20 yards of linen, and 40 lbs. of coffee = 20 yards of linen. Therefore 10 lbs. of tea = 40 lbs. of coffee. In other words, 1 lb. of coffee contains only a quarter as much of the substance of value, that is, labor, as 1 lb. of tea.</p><p>The General relative form of value of the world of commodities excludes only one commodity, the linen, on which it imposes the character of General equivalent. The bodily form of the linen is the common form taken by the value of all commodities. Linen is therefore directly exchangeable with all other commodities. The bodily form of the linen counts as the visible incarnation, the general social chrysalis state, of all human labor. Weaving, the private labor which produces linen, is at the same time labor in general social form, the form of equality with all other kinds of labor. The innumerable equations of which the general form of value is composed equate the labor realized in the linen with the labor contained in every other commodity. They thus convert weaving into the general form of appearance of undifferentiated human labor. In this manner the labor objectiﬁed in the values of commodities is not just represented negatively, as labor in which abstraction is made from all the concrete forms and useful properties of actual work.</p>',\n  altText:'<p>See, the System&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; its voodoo on ya already. You&rsquo;re startin&rsquo; to see how much you gotta sell to get 20 yards. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marx gives some examples of the shit people are willin&rsquo; to sell just to walk away with 20 yards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you can then use that 20 yards to buy somethin&rsquo; else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Buyin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; with linen turns it into the General relative form. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, everything can be made by weaving.

All labor makes linen. </p>'},\n  {text:'<p>Rather its own positive nature is explicitly brought out. It is the reduction of all kinds of actual labor to their common character of being human labor in general, of being the expenditure of human labor-power. The General form of value, in which all products of labor are presented as mere congealed quantities of undifferentiated human labor, shows by this general coverage alone that it is the social expression of the world of commodities. Thus it makes it plain that within this world the general human character of labor forms its speciﬁc social character.</p><p>1.3.C.2 <u>Interdependence of the Development of Relative Form of Value and Equivalent Form</u></p><p>The degree of development of the equivalent form corresponds to that of the relative form of value. However it should be noted that the development of the equivalent form is only the expression and result of the development of the relative form. The Simple or Isolated relative form of value of one commodity converts some other commodity into a Simple equivalent. The Expanded form of relative value, that expression of the value of one commodity in terms of all other commodities, imprints on those other commodities the form of various Particular equivalents. Finally, a particular kind of commodity obtains the form of General equivalent, because all other commodities make it the material embodiment of their uniﬁed and gen-eral form of value. Concomitantly with the development of the value form itself, however, develops also the antagonism between the relative form of value and the equivalent form, the two poles of the value form.</p>',\n  altText:'<p>All labor also becomes human labor, unitin&rsquo; everyone.

And they see that, pretty clearly, when they get a certain amount of physical linen in exchange for what they sell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anything made&rsquo;s just some amount of human labor.

Somehow, all commodities gotta be both a relative and equivalent form.</p>'},\n  {text:'<p>The ﬁrst form, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, already contains this antagonism, but does not attach it. According to whether we read the same equation forwards or backwards, each of the two commodity poles (such as linen and coat) is found in the relative form on one occasion, and in the equivalent form on the other. Here it is still difﬁcult to keep hold of the polar antagonism. In form B, only one commodity at a time can expand its relative value into a totality, and it only possesses this Expanded relative form of value because, and in so far as, all other commodities are with respect to it, equivalents. Here we can no longer reverse the equation—such as 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 lb. of tea or = 1 quar-ter of wheat etc.—without altering its whole character, and converting it from the Ex-panded form into the general form of value.</p><p id=\"c1-24\">Finally, the last form, C, gives to the world of commodities a general social relative form of value, because, and in so far as, all commodities except one are thereby excluded from the equivalent form. A single commodity, the linen, therefore has the form of direct exchangeability with all other commodities, in other words it has a immediately social form because, and in so far as, no other commodity is in this situation.<sub><a href=\"#f1-24\" class=\"black inline\"><b>24</b></a></sub></p><p>The commodity that plays the role of General equivalent is on the other hand excluded from the uniform and therefore General relative form of value. If the linen, or any other commodity serving as General equivalent, were, at the same time, to share in the relative form of value, it would have to serve as its own equivalent. We should then have: 20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen, a tautology in which neither value nor its magnitude is expressed.</p>',\n  altText:'<p>I mean, linen&rsquo;s switchin&rsquo; from relative form to equivalent form all the time, and same with the other commodity it&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; traded for. It&rsquo;s hard to keep track of if you&rsquo;re reppin&rsquo; the value of what you made in linen or if you&rsquo;re reppin&rsquo; the value of linen in what you made. This was already happenin&rsquo; in the Simple form too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Back in the Expanded form, indies chose their relative commodity, and everything else became its equivalent. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We reverse that to get to the General form&ndash; society chooses the equivalent commodity, and everything else becomes relative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing else can be General Equivalent in the General form.

It can only be an equivalent, right?</p>'},\n  {text:'<p>In order to express the relative value of the General equivalent, we must rather reverse form C. This equivalent has no relative form of value in common with other commodities; its value is, rather, expressed relatively in the inﬁnite series of all other physical commodities. Thus the Expanded relative form of value, or form B, now appears as the speciﬁc relative form of value of the equivalent commodity.</p><p>1.3.C.3 <u>Transition from the General Form of Value to the Money Form</u></p><p>The General equivalent form is one of the forms of value. Any commodity can therefore be the General equivalent. How-ever whatever commodity it is, it is only in General equivalent form (form C) because and in so far as all other commodities ex-clude it from their ranks and treat it as the equivalent.

The activity by which man changes the forms of the materials of nature in a manner useful to him is entirely accessible to the senses. The form of the wood, for instance, is altered when a table is made out of it. Nevertheless the table is still a piece of wood, an ordinary thing which can be seen and touched. But, as soon as the table steps forth as a commodity, it changes into something that has extrasensory features attached to its sen-suous existence. It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but in relation to all other commodities it turns itself on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far spleenier than if it suddenly were to begin dancing.<sub><a href=\"#f1-25\" class=\"black inline\"><b>25</b></a></sub>The mystical character of the commodity does not arise, therefore, from its use-value. No more does it spring from the content of the determinations of value. For in the ﬁrst place, however varied the useful labors or productive activities might be, it is a physiological truth that they are functions of the human organism, and that each such function, whatever may be its nature or its form, is essentially the expenditure of human brain, nerves, muscles, sense organs, etc.</p>',\n    altText:'<p>Look at the wigly trip we went on, tryin&rsquo; to explain commodities.

Something can&rsquo;t get made without a human doing labor. Even a robot that produces use-values needed to be made by humans first. And robots obey us. We don&rsquo;t obey &lsquo;em. Things that exist don&rsquo;t come from nothin&rsquo;. </p>'},\n    {text:'<p id=\"c1-26\">Secondly, regarding that which underlies the determination of the magnitude of value, namely, the duration of that expenditure or the quantity of labor, this quantity is even palpably distinguishable from the quality of labor. In all states of society, the labor time it costs to produce the means of subsistence must necessarily concern mankind, although not to the same degree at different stages of development.<sub><a href=\"#f1-26\" class=\"black inline\"><b>26</b></a></sub></p><p>And ﬁnally, whenever men work for each other in any way, their labor also assumes a social form. From where, then, arises the mysterious character of the product of labor, as soon as it assumes the form of a commodity? Obviously from this form itself. The equality of all human labors obtains the bodily form of the equal value quasi-materiality of all products of labor, . . . the measure of labor by time takes the form of the quantity of the value of the commodities, . . . </p>',\n    altText:'<p>2) We know this shit. We went through it a million times. But here it is again: the labor-time an abstract human had to work to make a commodity shows how much value it&rsquo;s got. Marx throws in a line about how societies have to deal with controlling the amount of labor time it takes to make really essential products. That control shows that the longer it takes to make something useful, the higher in value it must be to society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) If a solo can&rsquo;t make something themselves, they join up with other producers. Their labor becomes social labor. That&rsquo;s how things get made. That ain&rsquo;t confusing either. So, lemme ask again: where does the mystery come from? How can something that got labor uploaded into it get so mysterious if it becomes a commodity!?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here we go. Commodities get weird *because* they get exchanged: and that&rsquo;s what makes &lsquo;em commodities in the first place. In the System, these 3 obvious things go under something else&rsquo;s control. Products gotta enter the System to be commodities, and they start gettin&rsquo; exchanged. That&rsquo;s when the weird shit starts. Since all human labor is just humans doin&rsquo; labor, all human labor is equal to each other as a solo unit. The System allows human labor to take a form with unlimited power: here, human labor can make anything. Human labor, somethin&rsquo; totally abstract, actually takes on a form that can make anything. But to do this, everything it makes derezzes before our eyes, into somethin&rsquo; totally abstract: value. When you measure human labor-time, all you get is some amount of value: not the thing you made, but something that represents the thing you made.</p>'},\n    {text:'<p>What is mysterious about the commodity form is therefore simply that the social characteristics of men&rsquo;s own labor are reﬂected back to them as objective characteristics inherent in the products of their labor, as quasi-physical properties of these things, and that therefore also the social relation of the producers to the aggregate labor is reﬂected as a social relation of objects, a relation which exists apart from and outside the producers. Through this quid pro quo, the products of labor become commodities, sensuous things which are at the same time extrasensory or social.</p>',\n    altText:'<p>…And makin&rsquo; commodities gets fucked up here. Commodities remove any social connect the producers have to eachother in exchange. The products take over the whole deal. They figure out they&rsquo;re both from the same root (human labor), they connect. Then they literally become each other or reject each other based on if their values are the same. The producers can *only* sit tight on the side-lines. But at that point, nothing they can do can change a fuckin&rsquo; thing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The System&rsquo;s hiding some serious voodoo. Anything social about labor gets turned into abstract labor: labor that don&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; but make value. Makin&rsquo; friends, gettin&rsquo; hurt, feelin&rsquo; good&ndash; that *all* gets boiled down into makin&rsquo; the value of the commodity. And don&rsquo;t even think about social connections gettin&rsquo; made thru exchange. Everything social about exchange is actually taken care of by the commodities. You could fuck, suck, or kill the other seller&rsquo;s parents: the commodities would still treat each other like family, ready to take the other&rsquo;s place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your social life becomes a channel which the flows of electric dreams run thru: a glorified zombie of what you think your life is, your every social action gettin&rsquo; soulkilled by the psychopathic product you create. This fucked up humiliation, reducin&rsquo; humans into their barest data, is what turns products of labor into commodities.

In the act of seeing, however, light is in fact transmitted from one thing, the exterior object, to another thing, the eye. It is a physical relation between physical things. As against this, the commodity form of the products of labor, and the value relation in which it rep-resents itself, have absolutely nothing to do with the physical nature of the products or with any relations they have as physical objects.

This I call the fetishism, which sticks to the products of labor as soon as they are produced as commodities, and which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities.

Since the producers do not come into social contact until they exchange the products of their labors, the speciﬁc social characteristics of their private labors appear only within this exchange. In other words, the private labors take effect, through their activity, as elements of the social aggregate labor only through the connections which the act of exchange establishes between the products and, through the products&rsquo; mediation, between the producers. To the producers therefore, the social rela-tions between their private labors appear as what they are, i.e., not as direct social rela-tions of persons during their labor processes themselves, but rather as material relations of persons and social relations of things. It is only during the exchange that the products of labor acquire a uniform social objectivity as values, which is distinct from their varied sensuous objectivities as use-values.</p><p>This division of the product of labor into a useful thing and an embodiment of value is only then carried out in practice when exchange has become sufﬁciently extensive and important to allow useful things to be produced for the exchange, so that their character as values is already taken into account during production.

This is why he ﬁnds it necessary to prove that equal quantities of labor always have the same value. On the other hand, he has the hunch that, in so far as labor manifests itself in the value of commodities, it only counts as an expenditure of labor-power.</p><p>But then he views this expenditure merely as the sacriﬁce of ease, liberty, and hap-piness, not also as man&rsquo;s normal life activity.</p><p>He is guided here by the evidence of the modern wage laborer.</p><p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s anonymous predecessor, cited in note 9, is much nearer the mark when he says: &lsquo;One man has employed himself a week in providing this necessary of life . . . and he that gives him some other in exchange, cannot make a better estimate of what is a proper equivalent, than by computing what cost him just as much labor and time: which in effect is no more than exchanging one man&rsquo;s labor in one thing for a time certain, for another man&rsquo;s labor in another thing for the same time&rsquo; [Ano39, p. 39].</p><p>Note by Engels to the fourth German edition:] The English language has the advan-tage of possessing two separate words for these two different aspects of labor.

And cuz of that I&rsquo;ll give you what you can&rsquo;t do, that I made usin&rsquo; the same amount of effort. But Marx ain&rsquo;t playin&rsquo; with stupid units like effort. Our verbage on how hard one thing is to make over another comes from our experiences, but we can&rsquo;t *actually* know the experiences of the runner we&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; a deal with. How can we say how much harder somethin&rsquo; was to make for you than it was for me while we&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; a deal?

Of course the classical economists do, in actual fact, make this distinction, for they treat labor sometimes from its quantitative aspect, and at other times qualitatively. It does not occur to them that a purely quantitative difference be-tween different kinds of labor presupposes their qualitative unity or equality, and therefore their reduction to abstract human labor. For instance, Ricardo declares himself in agreement with Destutt de Tracy when the latter says: &lsquo;As it is certain that our physical and moral faculties are alone our original riches, the em-ployment of those faculties, labor of some kind, is our original treasure, and it is always from this employment that all those things are created which we call riches . . . It is certain, too, that all those things only represent the labor which has created them, and if they have a value, or even two distinct values, they can only derive them from that&rsquo; (the value) &lsquo;of the labor from which they emanate&rsquo; (Ricardo, The Principles of Politi-cal Economy, 3rd Edn, London, 1821, p. 334).</p><p>I shall content myself here with point-ing out that Ricardo puts his own more profound interpretation upon the words of Destutt. The Frenchman does, in fact, say on the one hand that all things which constitute wealth &lsquo;represent the labor which has created them,&rsquo; but he also says, on the other hand, that they acquire their &lsquo;two different values&rsquo; (use-value and exchange-value) from &lsquo;the value of labor.&rsquo; He thus lapses into the shallowness of the vulgar economist, who pre-supposes the value of one commodity (labor, in this case) so that he can then determine the val-ues of the other commodities. But Ricardo reads him as if he had said that labor (not the value of labor) is represented both in use-value and in exchange-value. Nevertheless, Ricardo himself pays so little attention to the twofold character of labor behind its twofold expression, that his whole chapter &lsquo;Value and Riches, their Distinctive Properties&rsquo; is largely devoted to laborious refutation of the trivialities of a J. B. Say.</p><p>And at the end he is therefore quite as-tonished to ﬁnd that while Destutt agrees with him that labor is the source of value, Destutt nev-ertheless also agrees with Say about the concept of value.</p>',altText:'<p id=\"f1-31\">Marx is talkin&rsquo; about his devplan to fork off of Ricardo&rsquo;s codebase.

That&rsquo;s close.</p><p>But they ain&rsquo;t seein&rsquo; that solo *real* labor-times get jacked in, soulkilled, turned into a single unit&ndash; allowin&rsquo; all labor to be reduced to a number measured by time.  Quantity (all different human labor) becomes a Quality: abstract labor, which turns into a quantity thru trackin&rsquo; socially necessary labor-time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ricardo&rsquo;s agreein&rsquo; with Destutt, some aristo who looks like he came up with the idea of labor bein&rsquo; value. Ricardo uses Destutt to say that my ability to work and think is built-in cyberware, which I use to make my wealth. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So everything (use-value and value) comes out of usin&rsquo; these built-in tools hardwired in us. The process of usin&rsquo; these tools is &ldquo;labor&rdquo;. But the Destutt quote Ricardo showed ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s labor that creates the value of commodities. Destutt&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; the value of human labor makes the value of commodities. Ricardo misread.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Destutt sees that labor creates value, but then fucks up and says that the value of labor creates the use-value and exchange-value of commodities. He&rsquo;s really fuckin&rsquo; wrong. Labor creates value, but not because it *has* value naturally. </p><p>Ricardo misread this fuck up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ricardo gets it right by gettin&rsquo; Destutt wrong: use-values and value rep some amount of labor. But he misses that labor got its head cleaved in to become concrete labor and abstract labor. Cuz of that, he misses that use values represent concrete labor while value represents abstract labor. Exchange is when one commodity holds value, while the other becomes value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ricardo doesn&rsquo;t see that the guy he agrees with actually thinks what Say thinks. Say and Destutt think the supply of a commodity creates value. The corpo-rat, Say, thinks amounts of objects have value. Destutt thinks amounts of labor have natural value. Ricardo&rsquo;s supposed to be against Say tho. It&rsquo;s quite a fuck up to agree with the guy who agrees with the guy you disagree with. </p>'},\n  {text:'<p><a href=\"#c1-32\" class=\"black\"><b>32.</b></a> It is one of the chief failings of classical political economy that it has never pursued the analysis of commodities and more speciﬁcally of commodity value to the point where it yields the form of value, i.e., that what turns value into exchange-value. Even its best representatives, Adam Smith and Ricardo, treat the form of value as something quite indifferent or extraneous to the nature of the commodity itself.</p><p>The reason for this is not solely that their attention is entirely absorbed by the analysis of the magnitude of value. It lies deeper. The value form of the product of labor is the most abstract, but also the most general form of the bourgeois mode of production. It characterizes this mode of production as a particular species of social production, and therewith as one of a historical and transitory character. If one considers it to be the eternal natural form of social production, one necessarily overlooks the speciﬁcity of the value form as well—and consequently that of the com-modity form, together with its further develop-ments, the money form, the capital form, etc.</p><p>That is why certain economists who are entirely agreed that labor-time is the measure of the magnitude of value, have the strangest and most contradictory notions concerning money, the universal equivalent in its ﬁnished form. This emerges sharply when they deal with banking, where the commonplace deﬁnitions of money will no longer do. Hence there has arisen in opposition to the classical economists a restored Mercantilist System (Ganilh etc.), which sees in value only the social form, or rather the insub-stantial ghost of that form.—</p><p>Let me point out once and for all that by classical political economy I mean all the econo-mists who, since the time of W. Petty, have in-vestigated the real inner structure of bourgeois relations of production, as opposed to the vul-gar economists who only ﬂounder around within the apparent structure of those relations, cease-lessly ruminate on the materials long since pro-vided by scientiﬁc political economy, in order to lend plausibility to the crudest phenomena for bourgeois daily food. Apart from this, the vulgar economists conﬁne themselves to systematizing in a pedantic way, and proclaiming for everlast-ing truths, the banal and complacent notions held by the bourgeois agents of production about their own world, which is to them the best possible one.</p>',altText:'<p id=\"f1-32\">What&rsquo;s leashin&rsquo; these infobros to not analyze what turns value into exchange value?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even the Ferrymen of the System, Adam Smith and Ricardo, treat value like its got nothin&rsquo; to do with how commodities act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This ain&rsquo;t just cuz they&rsquo;re obsessed with figurin&rsquo; out how we measure value. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See, it&rsquo;s a deeper problem.

Or per-haps Bastiat means that a mode of production based on the labor of slaves is based on a sys-tem of plunder? In that case he is on dangerous ground.

In the opinion of the German-American publication this is all very true for our own times, in which material interests are preponderant, but not for the Middle Ages, dominated by Catholicism, nor for Athens and Rome, dominated by politics.</p><p>In the ﬁrst place, it strikes us as odd that anyone should suppose that these well-worn phrases about the Middle Ages and the ancient world were unknown to anyone else.

Karl Marx created Capital Volume 1 to explain commodities, the value-form, and capitalist production. We have it, here, together, as simply as we could organize it, with some informal short summaries to help you understand what it means. The short summaries on the right have been handled by Johnny Silverhand, a Rockerboy, a real cyberpunk who knows what’s what when it comes to translating disgust-at-capitalism. But, just so you know, it’s the full text on the left that’s important/well thought out. This version of Capital Volume 1 was translated by Hans Ehrbar. <sub>Note: This is not corpo approved and we are not endorsed or affiliated with CDProjektRed.</sub>  </p>\n      <h2 id=\"top\" className=\"center\">{(chapters[elem][0].title).toUpperCase()}</h2>\n      <h2  className=\"faded-yellow center no-space\">――――――――――――</h2>\n      <br></br>\n      <div class=\"ua__item\"><div class=\"ua__item-content\"><div class=\"ua__item-content-left\"><h6 class=\"ua__item-column-title\">FULL TEXT</h6></div><div class=\"ua__item-content-right\"><h6 class=\"ua__item-column-title\">QUICK SUMMARY</h6></div></div></div>\n      <div class=\"ua__item-title\"></div>\n      {chapterSection()}\n      </div>\n\n    </section>\n    <footer className=\"l-footer__platforms\">\n      <div className = \"l-content\">\n        <div>\n          <ul className=\"l-footer__top-nav wide__platforms\">\n            <li className=\"l-footer__top-nav-cond\"><h1 className=\"yellow\">Select a Chapter</h1></li>\n            <li></li>\n\n  \n\n          <li className=\"l-footer__top-nav-cond\" id=\"select-chapter\">\n            {chapters[elem-1] ?(  <Link className = \"save-button\"  to={\"/cyberpunkcapital/chap-\"+(elem-1) + \"#top\"} onClick= {()=>{notifSave(0);}}>← Previous Chapter </Link>):(<span className=\"faded-yellow\">...</span>)}\n            </li>\n            <li className=\"l-footer__top-nav-cond\">\n            {chapters[elem+1]?(  <Link className = \"save-button\"  to={\"/cyberpunkcapital/chap-\"+(elem+1) + \"#top\"} onClick= {()=>{notifSave(0);}} > Next Chapter ></Link>):(<span className=\"faded-yellow\">More coming soon!</span>)}\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <ul className=\"l-footer__logos\" id =\"chapters\">\n          \n          {chapters.map((chap,index)=><li> <Link className = \"l-footer_button-present\"  to={\"/cyberpunkcapital/chap-\"+(index) + \"#top\"} onClick= {()=>{notifSave(0);}} ><h2 className={ elem === index?'faded-yellow':'yellow'}>{Capitalize(chap[0].title)}</h2></Link></li>)}\n          </ul>\n          <ul className=\"l-footer__links\">\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://paypal.me/pools/c/8vbGkmm37Q\">send a tip!</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://perebite.com/\">my other stuff</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cyberpunk.capital/\">insta</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://twitter.com/cyberpunkapital/\">twitter</a></li>\n\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/index.htm\">marxists.org</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://content.csbs.utah.edu/~ehrbar/akmc.htm\">hans ehrbar translation</a></li>\n            <li><a className = \"yellow\" target=\"_blank\"href=\"mailto:peter@perebite.com\">email me</a></li>\n\n\n\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </footer>\n    \n    </div>\n    </>\n    <div>\n    <ReactTooltip />\n\n    <ToastContainer closeOnClick={false} onClick={(e) => {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      console.log(chapters[elem][subelem].name);\n      window.location.href=pathname+'#'+chapters[elem][subelem].name;\n      }} />\n\n      </div>\n    </ThemeProvider>\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\n\n","import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nexport const useDarkMode = () => {\n    const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n    const [mountedComponent, setMountedComponent] = useState(false)\n\n    const setMode = mode => {\n        window.localStorage.setItem('theme', mode)\n        setTheme(mode)\n    };\n\n    const themeToggler = () => {\n        theme === 'light' ?
